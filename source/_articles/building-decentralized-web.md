## how ethereum could shard the web

Given the state of our 25-year old web and all the problems inherited from legacy 1970's systems design, we should pause and take inventory of those components which are fundamentally broken. Intersecting this concern with security, privacy, and censorship resistance, it should be painfully obvious that an all-out attack on Internet infrastructure is already underway.

And while cryptography first allowed us to secure our messages from prying eyes, it is increasingly being used in more abstract ways like the secure movement of digital value via cryptocurrencies. If PGP was the first major iteration of applied crypto and Bitcoin the second, then I anticipate that the interaction and integration of crypto into the very fabric of a decentralized web will be the refined third implementation.

### the explosion of web services

Taking a look back at the brief history of the web, most would agree that Web 1.0 was epitomized by CGI scripts generating templated content on a server and delivering it to the client in a final form. As browser technology advanced, experimentation with AJAX calls began, allowing us to asynchronously perform actions without having to reload the whole page.

Today we have technologies like AngularJS and EmberJS which facilitate seamless and live updates, but this is only a moderate step towards Web 2.5.

### amuse-bouche

The real Web 3.0 has yet to begin, but it could obliterate the notion of separating content from presentation by removing the need to have servers at all. Let's take a look at some of the underlying technologies the Ethereum Project aims to deliver:

*   _Contracts_: decentralized logic
*   _Swarm_: decentralized storage
*   _Whisper_: decentralized messaging

Technologies like Swarm could serve as the underlying static hosting infrastructure, removing the need to highly distribute and cache specific content. This effort will also allow replacement of typical content delivery networks (CDN) with a distributed hash table (DHT) pointing to file blobs, much how BitTorrent works.

So we've just replaced the need to have caches, reverse proxies, CDNs, load balancers, and the like to serve static content to users. Another way in which Ethereum could impact this traditional infrastructure is by replacing business logic application tiers with on-blockchain contracts.

How could all this be possible? Because the ethereum protocol also acts as a large distributed key-store, eventually user accounts, credentials, and reputation can be migrated on-blockchain with the help of the Whisper communication protocol. In this way, ethereum sets the stage for a total sharding of traditional infrastructure as we know it.

Evaluating this context in a larger diagram of any systems infrastructure, it's obvious that our current web isn't as privacy secure or censorship resistant as we desire. Economies of scale have allowed single institutions to control large segments of internet activity, often under the supervision of less-than-savvy governments.

As economics of the ethereum ecosystem mature such that open contracts for lowest-rate storage develop, a free market of content hosting could evolve. Given the nature and dynamics of P2P applications, popular content will readily scale as the swarm shares, rather than suffering from the buckling load of siloed servers. The net result is that popular content is delivered _faster_, not slower.

We've spent decades optimizing the protocols that the internet was first founded on, but it's time to recognize opportunities lost by continually patching the old system instead of curating a new, optimized one.

This metamorphosis will offer developers an opportunity to build the next-generation of decentralized, private, secure, censorship-resistant platforms that return control to creators and consumers of the next best idea. Anyone with a dream is free to build on this new class of next-generation decentralized web services without owning a credit card or signing up for any accounts.

Although we are not told to or expected to, we have an imperative to cherish and improve the very shared resources that some wish to disturb, manipulate, and control. Rather, we should rely on the internet to solve the problems of the internet.

Because of this, blockchain technologies like Ethereum will allow for simplification and lowering of cost not seen since the introduction of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). Extending the idea to beyond a simple web project, Ethereum hopes to demonstrate how fully decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can live wholly within cyberspace, negating not only the need for centralized servers, but also trusted third-parties.
