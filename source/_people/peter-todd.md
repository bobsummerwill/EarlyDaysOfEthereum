Peter Todd is a Canadian software developer and applied cryptography consultant who was an early contributor to Bitcoin development. He studied at the Ontario College of Art and Design in Toronto before pursuing a career in cryptocurrency development.

## Bitcoin Development

Todd became involved in the cypherpunk community as a teenager, communicating with figures like Adam Back and Hal Finney. He became a Bitcoin Core contributor and was known for his work on transaction fee policies, replace-by-fee (RBF), and his advocacy for keeping Bitcoin's block size small during the scalability debates of 2015-2017.

## OpenTimestamps

Todd created OpenTimestamps, an open-source project for creating provable timestamps using the Bitcoin blockchain. The system allows anyone to create a cryptographic proof that a piece of data existed at a certain point in time.

## Early Ethereum Criticism

Todd was an early and vocal critic of Ethereum, raising concerns about the complexity of Turing-complete smart contracts and the security implications of the platform's design. His critiques contributed to broader debates in the cryptocurrency community about the trade-offs between Bitcoin's conservative approach and Ethereum's more ambitious scope.
