Yann Levreau is a French C++ developer who worked on Ethereum's developer tooling from its earliest days—first on the [Mix IDE](/articles/mix/), then on an early version of the [Mist](/articles/mist/) browser, and later on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

## Joining ETHDEV

Yann joined the Berlin C++ team in November 2014. Gavin Wood announced his hire in [ÐΞV Update III](/articles/gavs-dev-update-iii/):

> "Yann, a recent arrival in Berlin from his native France will be joined by Arkadiy who is travelling all the way from Moscow to become part of the team. Both have substantial experience in C++ and related technologies and will be helping us flesh out the developer tools and in particular pave the way to the IDE vision."

He initially worked with Arkadiy Paronyan on the [Mix IDE](/articles/mix/).

## Early Mist Browser and Whisper

Before Fabian Vogelsteller joined, Yann built an early version of the Mist browser in C++. Fabian recalled:

> "Yann actually built an early version of the Mist browser, but in C++ or something like this." — Fabian Vogelsteller ([Episode 12](/videos/episode012-fabian-vogelsteller/))

When Fabian arrived in January 2015 and was tasked with building a [Whisper](/articles/whisper/) chat application, Yann provided him with the API endpoints needed to connect to the protocol.

## Remix

Yann transitioned to working on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), the browser-based Solidity IDE, alongside Liana Husikyan. Both were based in the Berlin office.
