Marek Kotewicz was a core developer on Ethereum's C++ team who built the JavaScript API ([web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js)) and JSON-RPC layer. He was based in the Berlin office and left with Gavin Wood to co-found [Ethcore](/articles/ethcore/) (Parity).

## JavaScript API and Web3.js

Marek worked on unifying the JavaScript front-end across Ethereum's C++ and Go clients. Gavin Wood described his work in [ÐΞV Update II](/articles/gavs-dev-update-ii/):

> "Marek has studiously been moving C++ over to a JSON-RPC and Javascript front-end fundamentally unified and bound to the Go client."

At [DEVCON0](/articles/devcon0/) in November 2014, Marek presented the JavaScript API in a workshop setting, explaining how it worked with smart contracts and what tools would be available for developers.

Fabian Vogelsteller, who became the first heavy user of web3.js while building the [Mist](/articles/mist/) browser, worked closely with Marek in the Berlin office:

> "I had to get into web3.js, which Marek was working on... I was literally the first user of that library and really contributed to that library as well." — Fabian Vogelsteller ([Episode 12](/videos/episode012-fabian-vogelsteller/))

## Departure to Ethcore

When Gavin Wood left the Ethereum Foundation, Marek was one of the core developers who joined him. Gavin wrote in his [farewell post](/articles/gavs-last-post/):

> "Together with core developers Arkadiy and Marek and a troupe of others, I'll be working to make The Dream a reality as part of a sparkly new venture."

After Marek's departure, Fabian Vogelsteller took over maintenance of web3.js.
