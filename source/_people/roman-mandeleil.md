Roman Mandeleil is the creator of [EthereumJ](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj), a pure-Java implementation of the Ethereum protocol. He independently built the Java client as a community volunteer, making it the fourth full implementation of Ethereum alongside the C++, Go, and Python clients.

## Independent Community Contributor

Roman came forward independently from the community to build the Java client, without being hired or commissioned by the Ethereum team. [Vitalik Buterin](/people/vitalik-buterin/) noted this in the July 2014 announcement of the Ether sale:

> "Originally, the intent was for only three implementations; however, a member of the community (Roman Mandeleil) has independently come forward with a functional Java client." — [Launching the Ether Sale](/articles/launching-the-ether-sale/)

[Gavin Wood](/people/gavin-wood/) acknowledged Roman's contributions in his [first development update](/articles/gavs-dev-update-i/) (October 2014), alongside fellow EthereumJ volunteer [Nick Savers](/people/nick-savers/):

> "Finally, I must thank the EthereumJ (Java client) volunteer developers Roman and Nick, both of whom have visited us in our prototype hub here in Berlin, and who work tirelessly to find different and innovative new ways of interpreting the formal protocol specification." — Gavin Wood

## DEVCON0

Roman attended [DEVCON0](/articles/devcon0/) in Berlin in November 2014, where Gavin Wood described meeting him as one of the highlights of his time with Ethereum:

> "Getting to know the awesome coders Martin and Roman at DevCon-0." — [Gavin Wood](/articles/gavs-last-post/)

## Ether.Camp and Later Work

After the initial EthereumJ development, Roman founded [Ether.Camp](https://github.com/ether-camp), a company that built tooling around the Java client, including a block explorer and the [Ethereum Harmony](https://github.com/ether-camp/ethereum-harmony) client. The Ether.Camp team was present at DEVCON1 in London in November 2015.

[Viktor Trón](/people/viktor-tron/) recalled Roman's role leading the Java client:

> "Java client was mainly led by what was his name? Roman Mandeleil, who kind of mysteriously disappeared after. I'm not sure what happened to him." — [Episode 10](/videos/episode010-viktor-tron/) with Viktor Trón

[Bob Summerwill](/people/bob-summerwill/) added context on Roman's later departure from the ecosystem around early 2017, noting that the Ether.Camp team had run Hack.Gold, a hackathon initiative that attracted some controversy.

## Legacy

EthereumJ demonstrated the strength of Ethereum's multi-client approach and its ability to attract independent contributors. The Java implementation served as the foundation for projects like [Status](/people/jarrad-hope/) (via an Android fork) and influenced the broader Java/JVM Ethereum ecosystem. The repository accumulated over 2,200 stars on GitHub before being archived in December 2024.
