Viktor started work on Ethereum in February 2014 after seeing Gavin Wood present Ethereum at a [Coinscrum "Alternative Stage"](https://web.archive.org/web/20140405100113/http://www.iamsatoshi.com/coinscrum-alternative-stage-london) meetup in London. He had previously seen [Vitalik](/people/vitalik-buterin/)'s Miami presentation and came with challenging questions about sharding, but was won over by the answers. The next day he was already hacking on the C++ codebase and submitted his first PR.

He was added to the early Skype group (around 20 people at the time) and began contributing to go-ethereum. He was hired by [Jeff Wilcke](/people/jeff-wilcke) in September/October 2014, negotiating with Aeron Buchanan. Viktor was among the first paid employees on the Geth team, joining around the same time as Alex van de Sande and [Felix Lange](/people/felix-lange).

Viktor's early work included the devp2p networking layer (later rewritten by [Felix](/people/felix-lange)) and various infrastructure tasks. In July 2014, [Jeff](/people/jeff-wilcke) shared the Geth to-do list with him and introduced him to the devp2p protocol.

Ethersphere was created by Viktor as a GitHub organization, one of the first Ethereum-related "brands" alongside [Eris Industries](https://erisindustries.com/). It became the home for Swarm development work with [Daniel Nagy](/people/daniel-nagy) and later [Zsolt Felföldi](/people/zsolt-felfoldi).

The Web3 vision (Ethereum + Swarm + Whisper as the "[Holy Trinity](/articles/holy-trinity/)") emerged in May 2014 at talks in Whitechapel, London. Viktor was deeply committed to this vision of a fully decentralized web stack.

Despite Swarm being officially defunded during the 2015 austerity period, [Jeff](/people/jeff-wilcke) allowed the team to continue working on it. The first Swarm release was included in Geth 1.5 in December 2016. Viktor recruited [Nick Johnson](/people/nick-johnson) to the Swarm team, where [Nick](/people/nick-johnson) developed ENS before spinning it out.

Viktor continued working within the Ethereum Foundation until 2018-2019, when the Swarm codebase was separated from Geth. The Swarm Association was founded in Switzerland, and the Swarm token was launched in 2021. The new Bee client was developed using [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) instead of [devp2p](/articles/devp2p/).

Swarm work continues to the present day with Viktor leading the project.
