Guillaume Ballet is a Geth core developer who joined the Ethereum Foundation in October 2017.

Shortly after joining, Guillaume presented "Whisper: Achieving Darkness" at Devcon 3 in Cancún (November 2017) alongside [Vlad Gluhovsky](/people/vlad-gluhovsky/), who was the primary developer of the [Whisper](/articles/whisper/) protocol. The talk explained Whisper's privacy properties and technical architecture - including its "dark, ephemeral" design goals where messages could not be traced to their origin.

[Whisper](/articles/whisper/) was the decentralized messaging layer of the original [Holy Trinity](/articles/holy-trinity/) of Web3, alongside [Ethereum](/articles/stiftung-ethereum/) (computation) and [Swarm](/articles/swarm/) (storage). The protocol was eventually deprecated, with [Waku](https://waku.org/) serving as its spiritual successor.
