Texture was the first "community guy", reading and having his mind blown by the White Paper as one of the very people outside of the initial set of recipients.  Here he is, presenting on Ethereum with [Vitalik]({{ '/people/vitalik-buterin/' | relative_url }}) on 15th December 2013!

Incidentally, this was a "Salon Talk" for DCTRL, right here in my Vancouver hometown! ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

*"Texture (Anthony d'Onofrio) is spearheading community development for Ethereum in North America, he has written many works on Decentralized governance & community incubators."*

Here are a couple of more recent interviews.  This one is from 2022:

As was this one, later that year:

In January of 2025, with dissatisfaction brewing around the Ethereum Foundation, Texture wrote an opinion piece in Coindesk signed off "With Love, Texture":

<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/01/21/the-ethereum-foundation-has-lost-its-way" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Ethereum Foundation Has Lost Its Way</a>

Love is a common theme for Texture, whose Medium account is:

He used to stand on street corners giving out "free hugs" from what I remember.  I'll have to ask him about that!

He posted this in 2018 on the fourth anniversary of the Miami beach house photo taken on 29th January 2014.  Shout out to [Steve Dakh]({{ '/people/steve-dakh/' | relative_url }}).

And, further down the thread he said this, with my own efforts at Maple Syrup diplomacy in full flood at that point:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/iamtexture/status/958023651411947520">https://x.com/iamtexture/status/958023651411947520</a></p>&mdash; Anthony D'Onofrio (@iamtexture) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamtexture/status/958023651411947520">January 29, 2018</a></blockquote>

And, a little later in the month in response to my epic "Calling for an End to Tribalism in Ethereum":

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/iamtexture/status/956932468321349632">https://x.com/iamtexture/status/956932468321349632</a></p>&mdash; Anthony D'Onofrio (@iamtexture) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamtexture/status/956932468321349632">January 26, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I stuck that epic rant into blog form a few days later:
