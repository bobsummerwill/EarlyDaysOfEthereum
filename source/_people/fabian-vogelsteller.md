Fabian Vogelsteller is a web developer who joined Ethereum in January 2015 and became one of its most impactful contributors, authoring ERC-20 (the token standard that enabled the ICO boom), building web3.js (Ethereum's JavaScript library), and serving as a core developer of the [Mist](/articles/mist/) browser.

## Joining Ethereum

Fabian joined ETHDEV in January 2015 with a strong background in Meteor.js development. He had authored a book on Meteor.js and created feindura, a flat-file CMS. His web development skills made him a natural fit for the Mist browser team led by [Alex van de Sande](/people/alex-van-de-sande/).

## web3.js

Fabian built and maintained web3.js, the JavaScript library that became the standard way for web applications to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Nearly every early Ethereum dapp used web3.js to connect to nodes and send transactions. The library remains one of the most widely used tools in the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Mist Browser

Fabian was a core developer of the [Mist](/articles/mist/) browser, Ethereum's ambitious attempt at a native Web3 browser. Working alongside [Alex van de Sande](/people/alex-van-de-sande/), [Ramesh Nair](/people/ramesh-nair/), [Luca Zeug](/people/luca-zeug/), and others, the team built a desktop application for browsing and interacting with decentralized applications.

## ERC-20

On November 19, 2015, Fabian co-authored EIP-20 with [Vitalik Buterin](/people/vitalik-buterin/), defining a standard interface for fungible tokens on Ethereum. The ERC-20 standard provided a common API for token transfers, approvals, and balance queries, allowing any token to be reused by wallets, exchanges, and other applications.

ERC-20 became arguably the most consequential Ethereum standard ever written. It enabled the 2017 ICO boom, during which thousands of projects launched tokens on Ethereum using the standard. The simplicity and composability of ERC-20 tokens transformed Ethereum from a smart contract platform into the dominant infrastructure for token creation and exchange.

## LUKSO

After leaving the Ethereum Foundation in 2018, Fabian founded LUKSO, a layer-1 EVM blockchain focused on social, culture, and creators. LUKSO uses an unmodified version of Ethereum's protocol but introduces new standards centered around digital identity through "Universal Profiles." The project reflects Fabian's long interest in making blockchain technology more user-friendly and socially relevant.
