# Taylor Gerring photos

In 2022, [Taylor Gerring](/people/taylor-gerring/) posted a series of photos from the early days of Ethereum on Twitter and then gathered those into a single thread to celebrate the 10th Anniversary in 2025.

- [Ethereum Pre-launch Photographs (JAN-FEB 2014)](https://x.com/TaylorGerring/status/1948427437731193004)
- [Ethereum Pre-launch Photographs (MAR 2014)](https://x.com/TaylorGerring/status/1948429487252644114)
- [Ethereum Pre-launch Photographs (APR-JUL 2014)](https://x.com/TaylorGerring/status/1948430165794566358)

I have started copying them across into this repository and will add captions to them all.  Maybe Taylor has higher resolution versions we can substitute in later, or additional photos which did not make the cut during this initial drop?

*GM! 8 years ago today, I arrived at the Miami house rented by Decentral. Since I showed up unannounced and there were no more beds, my only choice was to sleep under the stars. I don't know anyone, don't have a car, and don't know what I'm there to do.* - 25th January 2014

*8 years ago today, #Ethereum was formally announced in Miami. After a standing-room only talk and extended line of questions, we all shuffled into a hallway to make room for the next speaker. [Joe Lubin](/people/joseph-lubin/) and [Anthony Di Iorio](/people/anthony-di-iorio/) can be seen next to [Vitalik](/people/vitalik-buterin/) as the crowd encroaches* - 26th January 2014

*Late into the night, some of our team gathered on the back patio for interviews. In addition to those named in yesterday's photo, appearing below are [Charles](/people/charles-hoskinson/), Jon, [Jeremy](/people/jeremy-wood/), [Dino](/people/dino-mark/), and one unidentified smoker. My hammock is back and to the left. #EthYearsAgo* - 27th January 2014

*Ethereum at the end of January 2014. This photo was *not* taken with my phone, even though multiple cameras were used to capture the moment. This is my final share from Miami and occurred ~Jan 31. Next month, my photo journal will resume in Europe* - 31st January 2014

*8 years ago tonight was my last day as a typical Chicagoan. Taken at The Green Lady, I would get far too little sleep for my early flight the next morning. The time could not have come sooner, as I had all but lost my ability to talk about anything except blockchain #MyEthJourney* - 8th February 2014

*February 9, 2014 was the day when we arrived in Europe. I flew to Germany for a layover where I would meet up with Nick and fly to Zurich. Perhaps because of the approaching Valentine's Day‚Äîthe airline handed out free chocolates #MyEthJourney* - 9th February 2014

*Our AirBnB was half of a duplex next to a dairy facility. This is most of the village that we called home for several weeks. The views from this hill were stunning and provided a necessary balance to the chaotic beginning of the Ethereum Switzerland crew #MyEthJourney* - 9th February 2014

*Upon landing, we took a train ride southward to a small farming town by the name of Meierskapple. This was our view off the back patio #MyEthJourney* - 9th February 2014

*8 years ago was our first visit to Rotkreuz. We would eventually make a good friend from this place, but for now‚Äîit was the closest town with groceries to feed the growing team. I forget the reason these mannequins were on display, but maybe someone from the area knows? #Ethereum* - 10th February 2014

*Who loves food??? This is the very first culinary photo of (not too) many from 8 years ago with the Ethereum Switzerland team. Matthias was an excellent cook and prepared many of the meals in our first weeks, always careful to provide a veg only option ü§§ #EthereumPhoto* - 11th February 2014

*8 years ago today, the EthSwiss team started building a portal which would lay the tech groundwork for the Ethereum Crowdsale. We didn't know what it needed to do or when it would happen‚Äîso we worked together to build something fun ü§ù* - 12th February 2014

*8 years ago today, the EthSwiss crew welcomed [Stephan](/people/stephan-tual/) to our tiny AirBnB. We only end up staying 1 more night before having to relocate to somewhere with even less space.* - 13th February 2014
