Cameron Gray is a Vancouver-based cryptocurrency advocate, musician (frontman of Amble Greene), and co-founder of Decentral Vancouver. He organized the Vancouver Ethereum Meetup and was an early promoter of blockchain technology on the West Coast of Canada.

## World's First Bitcoin ATM

In late 2013, Cameron became the "chaperone" for the world's first Bitcoin ATM, a Robocoin machine installed at a Waves Coffee House in downtown Vancouver. His job was to help users navigate the machine and protect it from competitors — including one entrepreneur who sat next to the ATM with a sign reading "Don't Pay Transaction Fees" and offered to exchange money at lower rates.

As covered by Wired in January 2014:

> "I would do this job for free strictly for the wealth of knowledge I've gained from sharing info with people. I'm trying my best to stay on the cutting edge of blockchain technology as it evolves."

The self-described "neo-Gypsy crypto punk" was also living in a converted Chevy van that doubled as a recording studio at the time.

## Decentral Vancouver

Cameron co-founded Decentral Vancouver with Freddie Heartline, inspired by Anthony Di Iorio's Decentral Toronto. The space opened in February 2014 at 436 West Pender Street and served as a community incubator for decentralized technology, becoming ground zero for Vancouver's cryptocurrency scene.

Cameron was a passionate advocate for blockchain technology:

> "The block chain is one of the most significant inventions since the Internet itself. That sounds grandiose. I would say it's even more important than the Internet, even though it's built on the Internet. But from a socioeconomic standpoint, it changes everything."

## Burning Man 2014

Cameron participated in the first-ever crypto-themed camp at Burning Man 2014, organized by Gary Lachance of The Decentralized Dance Party, promoting Dogecoin and open source culture.
