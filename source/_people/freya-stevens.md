Freya Stevens was announced as a newly hired PR/Marketing lead in a November 2014 blog post by Stephan Tual:

> "As the media attention is now intensifying rapidly, I'm pleased to welcome Freya Stevens to the team as PR/Marketing lead. Freya will help us build a shared database of media leads, write articles and make complex technology palatable to the general public while identifying strong story angles. Freya is based out of Cambridge, UK."

[Bob](/people/bob-summerwill/) did not spot her name until October 2025 and he contacted her on LinkedIn, where she told him the full story:

> "I was offered a communications role just before the [first DEVCON](/articles/devcon0) - alongside [Vinay](/people/vinay-gupta/) who I greatly admire. But I found out I was pregnant and they said I would need to be in a hacker house in central London, In hindsight I think it would have been fine. But at the time [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) was an unknown."
> 
> "I invited [Vitalik](/people/vitalik-buterin/) and Stephan Tual to [Cambridge University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge) as I was helping the crypto currency society there to get off the ground. They came and met someone that I was also working with at the time, helping with the [Cambridge Bitcoin Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/cambridge-bitcoin/) - he was called [Justin Drake](https://x.com/drakefjustin) - a few years later he would join the team."

Here the blog post where she was prematurely announced.  She continues to work in the industry:
