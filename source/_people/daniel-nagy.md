Daniel started work at the Ethereum Foundation in October 2014 but said at ETHDEV0 that he had been watching from the sidelines since around April 2014.  He presented on Swarm at DEVCON0:

Daniel's original conception of Swarm went back as far as 2011, says Zsolt Feldfoldi:

Ethersphere was created in March 2014 by Daniel Nagy and Viktor Trón (maybe?), primarily as an umbrella for their Swarm development activities.

Daniel will have left the Ethereum Foundation in late 2015, at the same time as Viktor Trón, when Swarm work was defunded by the Ethereum Foundation under financial pressure.  The Swarm Foundation was founded much later.

Swarm work continues to the present day.

Is this Daniel? [https://github.com/k1n0k0?tab=overview&from=2014-12-01&to=2014-12-31](https://github.com/k1n0k0?tab=overview&from=2014-12-01&to=2014-12-31)
