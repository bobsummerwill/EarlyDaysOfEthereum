description: 'The "Red Wedding" was the meeting at Zug in June 2014 where Charles Hoskinson and Amir Chetrit were ejected from the project'

In early June of 2014, all of the co-founders headed to The Spaceship in Zug.  The original purpose of the trip was to have the in-person meeting which was necessary for individuals to be added to the Ethereum Suisse for-profit legal entity which had been used to organize the project to that point.

Charles, Anthony, Amir and Joe flew in from North America.  Mihai was living in Zug.  Jeff flew in from Amsterdam, Gav from Berlin, and Vitalik from his latest nomad location.

Tensions were at boiling point at that stage, so instead of a signing ceremony it turned into a "get all the venom out" bloodbath of a meeting on 3rd June 2014.

The leadership group (the 8 co-founders) was dissolved, with Vitalik asking Mihai, Jeff, Gav, Joe, Anthony to return, with Charles and Amir being removed.  They remained co-founders and, like all the other early contributors, they still received their ether allocations.  Stephan and Taylor were appointed to take their places.

This story is told in detail in The Cryptopians, Out of Ether and Infinite Machine, and has been mentioned in many other articles and interviews.

Charles is still incredibly bitter about these events.  He allegedly gave all of his ether allocation to Jeremy Wood in frustration.  Jeremy left the Ethereum project only a few months later.  Charles and Jeremy regrouped to found IOHK (now IO Global) and to build the Cardano blockchain.

Amir did not seem to care, given that he retained his ether allocation and now did not even need to do any more work.  He had been quite clear that his involvement was primarily motivated and he continued to spend lots of time on colored coins when while being an Ethereum co-founder.
