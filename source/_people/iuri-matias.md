Iuri Matias is a developer who created several pioneering Ethereum development tools, most notably the [Embark Framework](/projects/embark/) and EtherSim, the first Ethereum simulator in JavaScript.

## Embark Framework

Iuri created the Embark Framework, one of the first frameworks for building decentralized applications on Ethereum. Embark provided an integrated development environment for building serverless dApps using Ethereum, IPFS, and other decentralized platforms.

## EtherSim

Iuri also created EtherSim, the first Ethereum simulator written in JavaScript. EtherSim allowed developers to test smart contracts locally without connecting to a live network. Later forks of EtherSim became the basis for Ganache (originally TestRPC), one of the most widely used Ethereum development tools.

## Other Contributions

Iuri went on to serve as Head of Desktop at Status.im and as a core developer at the Ethereum Foundation working on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), the browser-based Solidity IDE. He also created Subspace, a library for building reactive dApps, and an early proof-of-concept for gasless Ethereum transactions (Transaction Relay).

He later joined the Logos Collective.
