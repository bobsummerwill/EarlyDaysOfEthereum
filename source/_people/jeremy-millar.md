Jeremy Millar was instrumental in founding the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](/articles/enterprise-ethereum-alliance/) and later became Chief of Staff at [ConsenSys](/articles/consensys/).

## Enterprise Ethereum Alliance

At [DEVCON2](/articles/devcon2/) in Shanghai (September 2016), Jeremy was one of the key drivers behind forming what would become the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. [Victor Wong](/people/victor-wong/) recalled his role:

> "It was really Jeremy Millar, who I think later went on to become chief of staff for ConsenSys, really kind of drove that... Jeremy Millar just thought like, this isn't working, like what's happening now isn't working. We got to get some proper structure."

The founding meeting took place at a Starbucks just outside the conference center, where Jeremy helped aggregate representatives from Microsoft, Santander, Deloitte, and other major enterprises:

> "During that day, we kind of aggregated a bunch of people in that coffee shop... There was like Jeremy, John Whelan was there from Santander, Matt Spoke came in... and we were all kind of saying, okay, we need this organization. We need to get this together."

By the end of the day, the group had committed to forming what would become the EEA, providing the enterprise blockchain ecosystem with the structure and standards it needed.
