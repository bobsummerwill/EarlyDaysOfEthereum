Vlad Gluhovsky was listed as "Developer, Whisper Project" on the [ÐΞV team page](https://web.archive.org/web/20151210143340/http://ethdev.com/#team) and was the primary developer of [Whisper](/articles/whisper/), the decentralized messaging protocol that formed part of the original [Holy Trinity](/articles/holy-trinity/) of Web3 alongside [Ethereum](/articles/stiftung-ethereum/) (computation) and [Swarm](/articles/swarm/) (storage).

Working on Whisper from 2015, Vlad developed the protocol through several major versions:

- **Whisper v2** - Early implementation in Geth
- **Whisper v5** - Major revision with improved efficiency
- **Whisper v6** - Final version before deprecation

The protocol was designed for "dark, ephemeral communication" - messages could not be traced to their origin, were not permanently stored, and provided plausible deniability. This privacy-focused approach used a flooding mechanism where nodes received many messages they couldn't decrypt, providing cover traffic that obscured communication patterns.

Vlad presented "Whisper: Achieving Darkness" at Devcon 3 in Cancún (November 2017) with [Guillaume Ballet](/people/guillaume-ballet/), explaining the protocol's privacy properties and technical architecture:

Whisper was eventually deprecated and removed from Geth. Its spiritual successor is [Waku](https://waku.org/), developed by [Status](https://status.im/), which builds on Whisper's design principles while addressing its scalability limitations.

## Family

Vlad's brother Alex Gluchowski went on to found [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/), the company behind [zkSync](https://zksync.io/), one of the leading zero-knowledge rollup Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum.
