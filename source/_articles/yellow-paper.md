The Yellow Paper was created by Gavin Wood as a formal specification of the Ethereum protocol sketched by Vitalik Buterin in the Ethereum White Paper a few months earlier.

Some people view the Yellow Paper as brilliant work while others find it very math-syntax heavy and unreadable.

Here is the [current version](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) and a snapshot of the [first release](https://web.archive.org/web/20140410013339/http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf) which was published on Gavin Wood's website.

The [Github repository](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper) was also created [on 1st April 2014](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/commit/0d0d23301d077bbdab5cafae6ab06001e282fae2).

The Yellow Paper has not been updated since 2023, and has been superceded by a [Python-based alternative](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/).
