Dino Mark was an early participant in the Ethereum community, involved from January 2014 during the project's pre-launch phase.

## The DAO and Ethereum Governance

Dino Mark became notably known for co-authoring a paper in 2016 analyzing vulnerabilities in The DAO's smart contract code. Along with Vlad Zamfir and Emin Gün Sirer, he published "A Call for a Temporary Moratorium on The DAO" which warned of security issues before the June 2016 hack occurred. The paper identified several critical vulnerabilities and recommended that investors hold off from directing The DAO to invest in projects until the problems had been resolved.
