Tim worked on the [ethash](https://github.com/ethereum/ethash) Proof of Work (POW) algorithm in 2014 and 2015.

He was brought on the project by Gavin Wood.  They had previously worked together at [Frontier Developments](https://www.frontier.co.uk/about-us), a UK videogames company founded by [David Braben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Braben), of [Elite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)) and [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) fame.

His first change was [commit 142a92e - **Visual Studio compile fixes**](https://github.com/ethereum/ethash/commit/142a92e966c46cbf186225e9e18b17b313ce8389
) and he made commits to ethash between [13th Jan 2014 and 29th Mar 2015](https://github.com/ethereum/ethash/commits?author=TiimJiim) and to cpp-ethereum between [16th Feb 2014 and 13th Mar 2015](https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/commits?author=TiimJiim).

*"I am very grateful to Tim, who continues to consult on our efforts at an ASIC-resistant proof-of-work algorithm, also implementing it in C++.*
