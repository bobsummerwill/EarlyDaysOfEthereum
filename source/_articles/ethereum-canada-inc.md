Ethereum Canada Inc. (Federal Corporation #8784825) was a Canadian corporation incorporated by [Anthony Di Iorio](/people/anthony-di-iorio/) in February 2014. The incorporation reflected Di Iorio's vision for Ethereum development to be centered in Toronto, where he had established [Bitcoin Decentral](https://decentral.ca/) as a cryptocurrency co-working space.

The company was incorporated just days before the early Ethereum team traveled to Zug, Switzerland, where the project ultimately established its legal home instead. As Bob Summerwill explained:

> "Anthony Di Iorio incorporated Ethereum Canada in February, actually, but it was about just a few days before everyone went to Zug. So his thought, I guess, was everything was going to happen out of Toronto, but that didn't happen."

With the decision to base Ethereum in Switzerland through [Ethereum Switzerland GmbH](/articles/ethereum-switzerland-gmbh/) and later the [Stiftung Ethereum](/articles/stiftung-ethereum/), Ethereum Canada did not become the project's primary organizational vehicle.
