Network Protocols, Encryption and C++ Client Development.

Alex started work as a volunteer on cpp-ethereum in January 2014, with his [first issue](https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/issues/6) logged on 31st Jan 2014 and his first commit being [commit b00fa34](https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/commit/b00fa34382461e1770f9e90e125a716dfa8eda12) on 2nd Feb 2014.  Both were related to macOS Mavericks support.

Alex was the very first hire for ETHDEV in Berlin, around August 2014 or September 2014.

*(For a long time, Bob was under the false impression that Alex Leverington was the first employee for the Ethereum Foundation as a whole, but Viktor Trón was hired earlier, in February 2014, by Jeff Wilcke (probably through EthSuisse).  Many other people were working on Ethereum for months before Alex was hired, of course, but not as paid employees or contractors)*
