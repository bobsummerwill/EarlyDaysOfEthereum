Michael Perklin is an information security expert who played an important role in the early Ethereum ecosystem through his involvement with Bitcoin Decentral in Toronto and his work on cryptocurrency security standards.

## Bitcoin Decentral and Early Ethereum

Michael was part of the Bitcoin Decentral community in Toronto, the co-working space founded by Anthony Di Iorio that served as an early hub for Ethereum development. His security expertise was put to use in the project's formative period.

According to Taylor Gerring, Michael had custom cases made for the open hardware which the Ethereum Foundation used as Bitcoin multisig devices:

## CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium

Michael co-founded the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4) in March 2014 to address the lack of security standards in the blockchain industry. He has served as Chairman of the Board, working to educate developers about security pitfalls and curating standards for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. He holds CISSP and CISA certifications among other information security credentials.

## Ethereum Crowdsale Security

Michael's security background made him a key contributor to the infrastructure surrounding the Ethereum crowdsale, helping to ensure that the significant funds raised during the sale were properly secured through hardware wallet and multisig arrangements.
