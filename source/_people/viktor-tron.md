Viktor started work on Ethereum in February 2014 after seeing Gavin Wood present Ethereum at a "new web" meetup in London. He had previously seen Vitalik's Miami presentation and came with challenging questions about sharding, but was won over by the answers. The next day he was already hacking on the C++ codebase and submitted his first PR.

He was added to the early Skype group (around 20 people at the time) and began contributing to go-ethereum. He was hired by [Jeff Wilcke](/people/jeff-wilcke) in September/October 2014, negotiating with Aeron Buchanan. Viktor was among the first paid employees on the Geth team, joining around the same time as Alex van de Sande and [Felix Lange](/people/felix-lange).

Viktor's early work included the devp2p networking layer (later rewritten by [Felix](/people/felix-lange)) and various infrastructure tasks. In July 2014, [Jeff](/people/jeff-wilcke) shared the Geth to-do list with him and introduced him to the devp2p protocol.

Ethersphere was created by Viktor as a GitHub organization, one of the first Ethereum-related "brands" alongside Eris Industries. It became the home for Swarm development work with [Daniel Nagy](/people/daniel-nagy) and later [Zsolt Felföldi](/people/zsolt-felfoldi).

The Web3 vision (Ethereum + Swarm + Whisper as the "holy trinity") emerged in May 2014 at talks in Whitechapel, London. Viktor was deeply committed to this vision of a fully decentralized web stack.

Despite Swarm being officially defunded during the 2015 austerity period, [Jeff](/people/jeff-wilcke) allowed the team to continue working on it. The first Swarm release was included in Geth 1.5 in December 2016. Viktor recruited [Nick Johnson](/people/nick-johnson) to the Swarm team, where [Nick](/people/nick-johnson) developed ENS before spinning it out.

Viktor continued working within the Ethereum Foundation until 2018-2019, when the Swarm codebase was separated from Geth. The Swarm Association was founded in Switzerland, and the Swarm token was launched in 2021. The new Bee client was developed using libp2p instead of devp2p.

Swarm work continues to the present day with Viktor leading the project.
