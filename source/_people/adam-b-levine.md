Adam B. Levine is a podcaster, writer, and media entrepreneur best known as the founder and host of the Let's Talk Bitcoin (LTB) podcast network, one of the earliest and most influential media platforms covering cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

## Let's Talk Bitcoin

Levine launched the Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast in 2013, creating a platform that became a key source of news, analysis, and discussion for the early cryptocurrency community. The show featured regular co-hosts Andreas Antonopoulos and Stephanie Murphy, and covered Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader blockchain ecosystem during its formative years.

The LTB Network expanded beyond a single podcast to become a content platform with multiple shows and contributors. It was one of the first media outlets to give significant coverage to Ethereum during its pre-launch phase in 2014.

## LTBCOIN and Tokenly

Levine experimented early with token-based media models, creating LTBCOIN on the Counterparty platform as a way to reward content creators and community participants. He later founded Tokenly, a company focused on token-based access control and digital ownership tools.

## Connection to Ethereum

Through the LTB Network, Levine provided early media exposure for Ethereum, hosting discussions with Ethereum founders and contributors during the project's crowdsale and development phases. The podcast served as an important communication channel for the early Ethereum community.
