Tim made commits to the cpp-ethereum and [ethash](https://ethereum/ethash) repos between [16th Feb 2014 and 13th Mar 2014](https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/commits?author=TiimJiim), all seemingly to Ethash, the POW algorithm.

He had previously worked with Gavin Wood at [Frontier Developments](https://www.frontier.co.uk/about-us), a UK videogames company founded by [David Braben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Braben), of [Elite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)) and [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) fame.

Tim's first change was [Commit 631cbd7](https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/commit/631cbd794bbe9ebd8065f2606272732a4dbf2b22
) - **"Fig bug picked up by unreferenced formal param warning"**.

*"I am very grateful to Tim, who continues to consult on our efforts at an ASIC-resistant proof-of-work algorithm, also implementing it in C++.*
