DEVolution GmbH (CHE-163.077.836) was a Swiss limited-liability company associated with the early Ethereum project. The company is now in liquidation.

The entity was one of several legal structures created during Ethereum's formative period in Switzerland, alongside [Ethereum Switzerland GmbH](/articles/ethereum-switzerland-gmbh/) (EthSuisse) and the [Stiftung Ethereum](/articles/stiftung-ethereum/) (Ethereum Foundation). While EthSuisse handled the initial commercial activities and the Stiftung served as the non-profit foundation, DEVolution GmbH's specific role in the organizational structure is less well documented.
