Joining ETHDEV in September 2014
DEVCON0
Cross-client testing (and how coordinating Amsterdam and Berlin worked)
Talking about the POCs and Olympia
Working towards the launch (how did you know it was "ready"?)
Ming coming in and "cleaning house"
The formation of http://slock.it
DEVCON1 kettle demo and announcing DAO
Building "The DAO"

And what you do now.
