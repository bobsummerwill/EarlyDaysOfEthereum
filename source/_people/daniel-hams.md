Daniel contributed to cpp-ethereum in early 2014.

He replied to Alex Leverington's [macOS Mavericks issue](https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/issues/6#issuecomment-33862054) on 31st Jan 2014.

And he made commits of his own to cpp-ethereum between [2nd Feb 2014 and 11th Mar 2014](https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/commits?author=danielhams), all seemingly related to macOS support.
