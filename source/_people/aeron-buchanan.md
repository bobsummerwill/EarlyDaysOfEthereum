Aeron Buchanan was one of the earliest members of the Berlin [ETHDEV](/articles/eth-dev-cic/) team, managing operations, finances, and administration for the hub. Originally brought on as a mathematical modeller, he became the indispensable organizer holding the Berlin office together.

## Berlin Operations

Gavin Wood described Aeron's evolving role in his [first development update](/articles/gavs-dev-update-i/):

> "Aeron Buchanan, though originally brought on as a mathematical modeller, has been very successful in coordinating Berlin's various operations including helping set up the arduous process of getting a bank account, recruitment, financial juggling to get people paid, technical interviews and other tedious administration tasks; more recently he has also been helping sort out the UK side of things, too."

Aeron served as company secretary and was appointed a director of [Ethereum ÐΞV CIC](/articles/eth-dev-cic/) in October 2014. He helped organize [DEVCON0](/articles/devcon0/) in November 2014, which Jeff Wilcke credited in the [Homestead release](/articles/homestead-release/) post: "It was a bit hectic for those who organised it (thanks Aeron, Christian & Jason!)."

## Recruiting Fabian Vogelsteller

In August 2014, Aeron attended a Berlin Bitcoin meetup where he met Fabian Vogelsteller. He told Fabian about the upcoming Berlin office and hinted at the presale announcement. When Fabian later visited the Waldemarstraße office to make his case for joining, Aeron was his point of contact:

> "I met these guys from Ethereum. In this case was Aeron, who did the accounting at the time... I showed him this as well and just said, Aeron, just ask around internally." — Fabian Vogelsteller ([Episode 12](/videos/episode012-fabian-vogelsteller/))
