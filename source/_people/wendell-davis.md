Wendell Davis was an early Ethereum contributor who was involved from January 2014. He was the creator of Hive Bitcoin wallet and later managed the Ethereum Foundation's DEVgrants program.

## Hive Wallet and Early Involvement

Wendell was mentioned in the [original BitcoinTalk](https://web.archive.org/web/20140208053651/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=428589.0) post in January 2014, although his role there was later [written out of history](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=428589.0), along with many others:

*"Wendell Davis - Strategic Partner and Branding (Hive Wallet)"*

[Taylor Gerring](/people/taylor-gerring/) met [Mihai Alisie](/people/mihai-alisie/) in Milan in late 2013 while working for Wendell at Hive Bitcoin wallet. That connection led Taylor to [Vitalik Buterin](/people/vitalik-buterin/) and the rest of the Ethereum team.

## Miami January 2014

Wendell was at the Miami house in January 2014 where many early Ethereum contributors met for the first time. [Gavin Wood](/people/gavin-wood/) mentioned him specifically in his [farewell post](/articles/gavs-last-post/):

> "From the amazement of meeting so many cool people (not least of whom Jani and Wendell) in Miami, Jan '14..."

## DEVgrants Program

Wendell later managed the Ethereum Foundation's [DEVgrants](/articles/devgrants/) program, one of the earliest grant programs supporting Ethereum ecosystem development. He presented on the program at DEVCON1 in November 2015:
