Gavin Wood is an Ethereum co-founder who authored the [Yellow Paper](/articles/yellow-paper/) (Ethereum's formal technical specification), created [Solidity](/articles/solidity/), and led the [C++ client](/articles/cpp-ethereum/) development. He was one of three directors of [Ethereum ÐΞV](/articles/eth-dev-cic/) alongside [Vitalik Buterin](/people/vitalik-buterin/) and [Jeff Wilcke](/people/jeff-wilcke/).

## Early Development

Gavin started building the C++ implementation of Ethereum just days after Christmas 2013, around the same time Jeff Wilcke began the Go client. Bob Summerwill described the timing:

> "Various other people sort of joined in on the efforts in December, including Gav and Jeff who started the C++ and Go clients, respectively, at the very end—at the very end of December, kind of Christmas projects for them both." — Bob Summerwill

## The Yellow Paper

In April 2014, Gavin published the [Yellow Paper](/articles/yellow-paper/)—the formal mathematical specification of the Ethereum protocol. This document provided the rigorous technical foundation that enabled multiple independent implementations to achieve consensus.

## Leadership and Vision

Gavin introduced himself in his [first development update](/articles/gavs-dev-update-i/) (October 2014):

> "I'm Gav - together with Jeffrey Wilcke and Vitalik Buterin, I'm one third of the ultimate leadership of Ethereum ÐΞV."

He was based primarily in Zug, Switzerland (Ethereum HQ) during the early period, and set up the Berlin ETHDEV hub with a team including [Aeron Buchanan](/people/aeron-buchanan/), [Sarah O'Neill](/people/sarah-oneill/), and [Jutta Steiner](/people/jutta-steiner/).

## Technical Contributions

Beyond the Yellow Paper, Gavin made foundational technical contributions:

- **[Solidity](/articles/solidity/)** - Designed the smart contract programming language with [Christian Reitwießner](/people/christian-reitwiesner/)
- **[Whisper](/articles/whisper/)** - Developed the secure messaging protocol
- **[Mix IDE](/articles/mix/)** - Created the Ethereum development environment
- **Light Client Protocol** - Designed the protocol for lightweight Ethereum clients
- **ICAP** - Created the IBAN-compatible Inter-exchange Client Address Protocol

## Development Philosophy

Gavin documented Ethereum's unique development process in March 2015:

> "So I'm not sure if this kind of development methodology has ever been applied to such an extreme before so I figured I'd document it. In a nutshell, it's sort of like test-driven triplet-programming development."

[Christoph Jentzsch](/people/christoph-jentzsch/) observed the contrast between development styles:

> "There was always a fight between Geth and the C++ team about who's the best. And Gavin was having a big ego. And Jeff was more like, just give me the new spec, I just code it." — Christoph Jentzsch

Fabian Vogelsteller, hired by Jeff's Amsterdam team but sitting in Gavin's Berlin C++ office, experienced the team dynamics firsthand:

> "I also realized that Jeffrey's team and Gavin's team was a little disconnected... Gavin really wanted to kind of keep everybody under a bucket and he didn't want that we talked to this team. But I kind of found back ways and back channels to make them sync up." — Fabian Vogelsteller ([Episode 12](/videos/episode012-fabian-vogelsteller/))

Building the [Mist](/articles/mist/) browser required working across both client stacks, and Fabian found that getting the RPC API cleaned up before mainnet was "quite already like a little bit of an uphill battle."

## DEVCON0

Gavin organized [DEVCON0](/articles/devcon0/), the first Ethereum developer symposium, held in Berlin in November 2014. His opening statement set the tone:

> "Progress has led to the concentration of power... Our mission therefore is decentralisation."

## The Red Wedding

Gavin was present at the June 2014 "[Red Wedding](/articles/red-wedding/)" meeting in Zug where Charles Hoskinson and [Amir Chetrit](/people/amir-chetrit/) were removed from leadership. He remained part of the continuing leadership group alongside Vitalik, Jeff, [Joe Lubin](/people/joe-lubin/), and [Anthony Di Iorio](/people/anthony-di-iorio/).

## Departure and Ethcore

During the Ethereum Foundation's 2015 funding crisis, tensions grew. [Jacob Czepluch](/people/jacob-czepluch/) observed the early formation of what would become Ethcore:

> "Sitting as the only person working on the Python client in that office in my small corner, I had a lot of fun kind of following how people came and went and went into Gavin's office and had a chat there with him and Jutta or whatever."

In January 2016, Gavin wrote his farewell post to the Ethereum Foundation:

> "Like The Floyd's work, in the time I've been involved with Ethereum, I've sampled the full gamut of emotion... The road ahead is surely bumpy but we know what we have to do and the views, I expect, will be magnificent. Goodbye and thanks for all the fish."

Gavin founded [Ethcore](/articles/ethcore/) (later renamed Parity Technologies) in the UK with [Björn Wagner](/people/bjorn-wagner/) and Jutta Steiner.
