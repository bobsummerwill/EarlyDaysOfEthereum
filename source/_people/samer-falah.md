Samer Falah was a blockchain engineer at JPMorgan Chase who was deeply involved in the development of [Quorum](https://github.com/Consensys/quorum), JPM's permissioned fork of Geth. Quorum added private transactions and an experimental smart contract-based consensus mechanism.

At [DEVCON2](/articles/devcon2/) in Shanghai (September 2016), Falah was very keen to meet [Bob Summerwill](/people/bob-summerwill/), though Bob could not understand why at the time. It was because JPM had been working on Quorum for months with [Jeff Wilcke](/people/jeff-wilcke/) and were about to launch it, but Falah could not say so publicly yet.
