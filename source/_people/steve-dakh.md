Steve Dakh was listed as a developer on the original Ethereum announcement, through his role at KryptoKit. He was one of the earliest people involved in the project.

## Original BitcoinTalk Announcement

Steve was mentioned in the [original BitcoinTalk](https://web.archive.org/web/20140208053651/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=428589.0) post in January 2014, although his role there was later [written out of history](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=428589.0), along with many others:

*"Steve Dakh - Developer (KryptoKit)"*

KryptoKit was a Bitcoin wallet browser extension co-founded by Anthony Di Iorio. Steve's inclusion in the original announcement reflects the close ties between Ethereum's founding team and the KryptoKit/Bitcoin Decentral community in Toronto, where much of the early organizational work for Ethereum took place.
