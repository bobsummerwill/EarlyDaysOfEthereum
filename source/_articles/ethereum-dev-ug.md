---

Ethereum DEV UG was a German Unternehmergesellschaft (UG) — a limited liability entrepreneurial company — established in Berlin in 2014. It served as the legal entity for Ethereum's development operations before the creation of the larger Ethereum Dev GmbH.

## Purpose

The UG form is a simplified version of the German GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) that can be established with minimal share capital (as low as €1). Ethereum DEV UG was used as the contracting entity for development work, including signing contracts with external development firms.

For example, Ethereum DEV UG signed a contract with the Polish firm Imapp sp. z o.o. in Warsaw for work on the C++ JIT VM (evmjit), carried out by Paweł Bylica and Artur Zawłocki starting in November 2014.

## Directors

The entity was established by members of the Ethereum founding team, including Vitalik Buterin, Jeffrey Wilcke, and Gavin Wood, who were also involved in the subsequent Ethereum Dev GmbH.

## Relationship to Other Entities

Ethereum DEV UG was part of the broader organizational structure that included:

- **Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum)** — the Swiss non-profit foundation established in Zug
- **Ethereum Dev GmbH (ETHDEV)** — the Berlin-based limited-liability company that succeeded the UG for larger-scale development operations
- **DEVgrants** — the grants program administered by ETHDEV

The UG served as a transitional legal vehicle during Ethereum's early organizational phase, before the more formal GmbH structure was put in place.
