Bitcoin Expo 2014 was the first Bitcoin Expo in Canada, held April 11-13, 2014 in Toronto. Organized by Anthony Di Iorio through the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada and hosted at Bitcoin Decentral, it was a pivotal early event for Ethereum.

## Ethereum as Sponsor

Ethereum was the main sponsor of the conference, and this was the only time Ethereum ever had an exhibition booth at a conference. By this point, Gavin Wood had spent four months building the first working client and completing the Yellow Paper spec.

> "Anthony Di Iorio running that, he'd got Bitcoin Decentral sort of co-working space and venue... He was the head of the Bitcoin Association of Canada. The Bitcoin Association were running the conference. Ethereum were the main sponsor for the conference." — Bob Summerwill

The event was significant for the early Ethereum team as it brought many members together for the second time after the initial Miami conference.

## In Crypto We Trust Hackathon

The conference featured the "In Crypto We Trust" hackathon, which ran April 10-11, 2014. The hackathon attracted many notable crypto developers and offered a $15,000 prize.

### Dark Market

Amir Taaki and his team won the hackathon with Dark Market, a decentralized marketplace prototype:

> "We did the Dark Market just purely for money. Because, you know, $15K." — Amir Taaki

Dark Market would later evolve into OpenBazaar.

## Vitalik's Presentation

Vitalik Buterin gave a rare early presentation on Ethereum at the conference, explaining the project's vision and technical approach.

## Internal Tensions

The event also surfaced some of the internal tensions that would lead to the "Red Wedding" later that year. Taylor Gerring described issues with co-founder Amir Chetrit:

> "I think those kind of conversations came to a head when he was wearing swag of a different organization in Toronto when we had that Bitcoin Expo 2014 and I ended up in the basement of the office there on the phone with like a Cloudflare type company to provide DDoS protection and I'm just like I don't understand why I'm on the phone having the big boy meeting and Amir, who's supposed to be doing this, is not." — Taylor Gerring
