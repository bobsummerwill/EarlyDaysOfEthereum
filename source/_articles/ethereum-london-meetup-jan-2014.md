One of the earliest Ethereum community meetups took place in London on January 29th, 2014, just three weeks after Vitalik Buterin published the Ethereum white paper on January 10th, 2014.

This was during the very early days when the Ethereum project was still taking shape. The London crypto community, particularly through groups like Coinscrum, was one of the first to engage with Ethereum.

Shortly after this meetup, Gavin Wood presented Ethereum at a Coinscrum event in London on February 3rd, 2014:

London would go on to become a major hub for Ethereum development and community activity, eventually hosting DEVCON1 at Gibson Hall in November 2015.
