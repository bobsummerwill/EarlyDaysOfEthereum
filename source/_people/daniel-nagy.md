Daniel started work at the Ethereum Foundation in October 2014 but said at ETHDEV0 that he had been watching from the sidelines since around April 2014.  His original conception of Swarm went back as far as 2011.

Daniel cofounded Ethersphere in Budapest in 2015 with Zsolt Felföldi and Viktor Trón as an umbrella for their development activities, primarily on Swarm.
