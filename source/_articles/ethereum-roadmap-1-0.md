The Ethereum Roadmap 1.0 was the original development roadmap published on ethereum.org in 2014, outlining the planned phases for Ethereum's launch and subsequent development.

The roadmap laid out the release sequence that would guide Ethereum from testnet to mainnet:

1. **Olympic** — The testnet release for stress-testing and bug bounties
2. **Frontier** — The initial mainnet launch (July 30, 2015)
3. **Homestead** — The first production-ready release (March 14, 2016)
4. **Metropolis** — Enhanced usability and smart contract improvements
5. **Serenity** — The long-term vision including proof-of-stake

This phased approach was characteristic of the early Ethereum project's planning under the technical leadership of [Vitalik Buterin](/people/vitalik-buterin/), [Gavin Wood](/people/gavin-wood/), and [Jeff Wilcke](/people/jeff-wilcke/).
