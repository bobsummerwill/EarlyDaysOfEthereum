Freya Stevens was announced PR/Marketing lead, based out of Cambridge, UK, in a November 2014 blog post by Stephan Tual:

> "As the media attention is now intensifying rapidly, I'm pleased to welcome Freya Stevens to the team as PR/Marketing lead. Freya will help us build a shared database of media leads, write articles and make complex technology palatable to the general public while identifying strong story angles. Freya is based out of Cambridge, UK."

Bob did not spot her name until October 2025 and he contacted her on LinkedIn, where she told Bob the story:

> "I was offered a communications role just before the first Devcon - alongside Vinay who I greatly admire. But I found out I was pregnant and they said I would need to be in a hacker house in central London, In hindsight I think it would have been fine. But at the time Ethereum was an unknown. 
> 
> I invited Vitalik and Stephan Tual to Cambridge university as I was helping the crypto currency society there to get off the ground. They came and met someone that I was also working with at the time, helping with the Cambridge Bitcoin Meetup - he was called Justin Drake - a few years later he would join the team."
