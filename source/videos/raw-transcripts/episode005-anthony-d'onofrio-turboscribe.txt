**Texture:** (1:19 - 1:19)
Can you hear me?

**Jaime:** (1:27 - 2:25)
Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Excellent.

Happy Strato Spaces. GM. What's up, guys?

How are you? I'm good. First week of September.

I'm not sure if it's officially the first week of fall. But nevertheless, super 
excited for a new month. I know at Strato we have a very exciting month ahead.

**Texture:** (2:28 - 2:53)
I think technically fall starts either 21st or 22nd. But spiritually, it starts 
after Labor Day, of course. I don't know if anyone has a white suit.

I actually sort of have a white suit. And you can no longer wear those already.

**Jaime:** (2:55 - 3:00)
Might have to see that. White suit's pretty nice.

**Texture:** (3:02 - 3:15)
I may have a photo. I think it's been worn to two sort of summer weddings. And 
that's the only time it's been.

But I could probably dig one up for you, Jamie.

**Jaime:** (3:16 - 3:20)
Yeah. Texture, welcome.

**Texture:** (3:23 - 3:25)
We had him. We lost him.

**Jaime:** (3:31 - 3:50)
Give it a few more minutes for some more folks to pile in. Yeah, yeah. 
Spiritually, fall is here.

Along with football. To the behest of our European counterparts.

**Texture:** (3:55 - 4:05)
By the way, for Spaces resiliency, Chad GPT is recommending two co-hosts up 
front. Now, do we already have the two? Or can you add another one?

**Jaime:** (4:06 - 4:09)
Yeah. You and Bob are co-hosts.

**Texture:** (4:10 - 4:16)
Okay. Just appears as speaker to me. Maybe it appears as co-host to Bob on 
Bob's side.

Bob, are you a co-host successfully?

**Bob:** (4:18 - 4:19)
It appears so.

**Texture:** (4:20 - 4:22)
I see it now. Okay. Fantastic.

**Jaime:** (4:33 - 4:34)
All right. Cool.

**Texture:** (4:36 - 4:54)
Very, very kind of cool August. For those of us who spent some of it in New 
York, like August is supposed to be hot. And it mostly wasn't.

Like there's supposed to be a sharp transition heading into the fall. But it 
feels like it kind of started early this year. I don't know what's going on.

**Jaime:** (4:57 - 5:02)
Yeah, completely agree. A lot of long sleeves and sweatshirts during the night.

**Texture:** (5:09 - 5:13)
Cooler. You guys are old. Been around talking about the weather.

**Jaime:** (5:15 - 5:15)
We're waiting for you.

**Texture:** (5:16 - 5:17)
Well, I'm here.

**Jaime:** (5:18 - 5:20)
Even better. Welcome.

**Texture:** (5:21 - 5:22)
What's up?

**Jaime:** (5:23 - 5:36)
GM. Yeah, great to kick this off. I'll hand the mic over to Bob, but I just 
want to pay my compliments to your PFT texture.

It's quite a good one.

**Texture:** (5:37 - 5:39)
So, welcome. Do you own a texture pump?

**Jaime:** (5:40 - 5:50)
I do not. But I saw a few folks with them and obviously noticed yours. So, Mike 
might have to get one.

**Texture:** (5:51 - 6:12)
It was a joke because I thought punks were ugly. So, I made myself a better 
one. And then a friend asked me to make her one.

And then somebody else asked me to make one. And then like 30 people later I 
was like, I should just fucking make a little thing where they can make their 
own. And then my buddy started a discord and 10,000 people showed up and I was 
like, look.

**Jaime:** (6:14 - 6:17)
That's some good lore. That's some great lore right there.

**Texture:** (6:20 - 6:23)
I thought it was going to be me and my hundred friends.

**Bob:** (6:26 - 6:37)
Accidental success. Fantastic. Great.

All right. Well, let's get going. Let's do it.

Hi, Texture.

**Texture:** (6:38 - 6:44)
How are you? It's been a while. It's been a long time.

Always good to hear from you.

**Bob:** (6:44 - 6:49)
When I think of you, the first thing I think of is love.

**Texture:** (6:49 - 6:49)
Oh.

**Bob:** (6:52 - 7:04)
And something I've spotted going through making my notes is your medium is 
called Peace Love Revolution. Yes. So, what's the story there?

**Texture:** (7:06 - 8:27)
So, you know, I was kind of, I wouldn't say a hippie. I didn't dress like a 
hippie. I didn't really hang out with hippies, but I took some psychedelics 
when I was a kid and I had some experiences and kind of drove my passion for 
doing good things and spreading love in the world.

I know people that probably follow me are like, what the fuck? He just calls 
people retards all day. Yeah, but I mean, I'm on Twitter.

I don't know. It's full of retards. So I started this group called Peace Love 
Human because I was like sitting in a shitty basement apartment in San 
Francisco and I was watching the news and I was seeing how religions got all 
fucked up.

And I was like, what if there was like a religion that didn't have any beliefs? 
And we just went out and did nice shit. So for like three years of my life, I 
was just like homeless and had no job and wanted to like free hug events and 
like other stuff just to make people smile.

Because like, you know, making people feel loved or making people happy was not 
like a quantifiable metric, but making people smile was. So that was that was 
what I did. For my early 20s.

So that's what I was doing. Community building. I accidentally started a cult 
and when I realized that it was a cult, I shut it down.

**Jaime:** (8:29 - 8:30)
Okay.

**Texture:** (8:31 - 8:36)
But it helped me, you know, it was my first foray into cult building, which 
obviously. Right.

**Bob:** (8:36 - 8:37)
Very useful.

**Texture:** (8:38 - 8:41)
I took into my role in Ethereum and I feel like the Ethereum cult is going 
pretty well.

**Bob:** (8:43 - 8:49)
I seem to remember at some point you told me that you probably hugged a 
thousand random people on the street.

**Texture:** (8:49 - 9:10)
Oh, a thousand in a day. Probably probably a hundred thousand or more. Yeah.

It was nice. It was good. I could waste this entire thing telling that story.

That's probably not what people want to hear.

**Bob:** (9:12 - 9:17)
I mean, I can see why Decentralized Dance Party also appealed to you on that 
score.

**Texture:** (9:18 - 9:52)
Yeah, that's so DDP. Gary, the guy who runs that, he came and stayed in my 
apartment in Brooklyn. And we had this three story loft in a warehouse and we'd 
let people come crash and he came through.

And that's how I met him. And I've done three or four of them. I was, I was.

What is it? It's Tom. I was Tom.

So Tom is like a rotating. I was Tom one time. So that was fun.

I just shaved my beard. I had a mustache. I looked funny.

**Bob:** (9:55 - 10:06)
I'll drop some links on Twitter for that for anyone who hasn't seen 
Decentralized Dance Party or you can go and have a Google on your own. It's 
quite exceptional.

**Texture:** (10:07 - 10:18)
It's funny. I had a no. I didn't really understand the decentralized thing at 
that point.

I was not really involved. So he was kind of ahead of the curve on that with me.

**Bob:** (10:19 - 11:03)
For sure. So yeah, that's Gary Lachance, who was a fellow Vancouverite with me. 
He was, funnily enough, in a photo for the very first item I could find about 
Vancouver Decentral.

The whole Decentral Toronto Vancouver thing. Gary was in that photo for the 
first one. Maybe well known as well now, but the Doge Claren.

So there is the Doge wrapped McLaren, which travels around many, many 
conferences where they can get financial support for that. Yeah, Gary's a great 
guy.

**Texture:** (11:04 - 11:04)
It's pretty fun.

**Bob:** (11:10 - 11:40)
So tell me about the vision that you had, which was then the same as the white 
paper. Because on the Twitter thread, I was wrongly saying your mind was blown 
by the Ethereum white paper, where actually what happened was that you'd had a 
vision of this about a week before, and then the white paper landed on your 
lap. So what the hell was that about?

**Texture:** (11:40 - 15:59)
Yeah. So what actually happened was I had a roommate for years ago, like years 
when I lived in New York, and he had tried to get me into Bitcoin when it was a 
dollar. And I said, this is like internet nerd money.

I'm like a love revolutionary. I don't give a shit about this. And then he kept 
bothering me about it for years.

And then it hit $1,400. And I was kind of humble enough to be like, well, if 
other people think it's worth something, I guess it is. But he had texted me 
and he said, listen, man, I want you to listen to this podcast.

And it was the Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast with Adam B. Levine and Andreas 
Antonopoulos. So I had given up working in tech because my arms had given out.

I was a programmer and designer for a very long time. And I had started making 
cannabis edibles in California because it seemed like an industry that was 
going to be pretty easy to get into. Like the marketing, the production, 
everything was shit.

And I was pretty good at it. So I had a girlfriend who was about four hours 
away and I would go visit her on the weekends. So I threw the Bitcoin podcast 
on.

And I ate one of my candies and don't drive stone, kids. But yeah, on the way 
there, I was listening and listening to the podcast. And my brain is kind of 
tuned in.

And I had what I can only describe as a biblical vision. I would say before 
that I wouldn't have understood what that meant. But just this massive data 
download into my head where I could basically see the future visually.

I just saw the whole thing playing out in front of me. And I was like, oh, 
shit. You know, Bitcoin, I'm still not particularly fascinated by.

But the blockchain idea has an amazing amount of potential. And I kind of saw 
how it could help people coordinate. And so it just kind of struck me so much 
that I was like, I got to go talk to Adam.

I got to go meet the people who did this podcast. Because at that time, it was 
the only Bitcoin podcast. And I thought anybody who wanted attention for what 
they were doing would probably contact them.

So the buddy that had told me to listen to the podcast randomly came into town 
three days later. And I said, hey, man, I've been thinking a lot. I listen to 
the podcast.

I have a lot of ideas. I need to meet Adam. I need to meet.

And he goes, well, actually, I'm flying out in a couple of days to go meet him. 
We have a meeting scheduled. He's in Washington celebrating his birthday with 
his wife.

And I said, no, no, no, no. We're getting in my car right now. I'm driving.

I'm driving us there. I'm going. I'm going to go talk to him.

And he's like, what, really? And I'm like, yeah, fucking cancel your ticket. 
Like, we're getting in my car right now.

So we drove like 20 hours or whatever to like Washington State. I walked in. 
Pretty much, I don't know what their meeting was about, but I pretty much just 
took Adam to the side.

And we ended up sitting in his hot tub on his balcony for like nine hours just 
talking. And it was a really cool. It was a really cool, you know, discussion.

And I said, you know, what I want from you is I want you to tell me anybody you 
know who's working on anything like this. And he said, well, you know, do you 
know who Vitalik is? I said, man, I'm not in crypto.

I'm not in Bitcoin. I don't know. I don't know anybody.

I don't know anything. And he said, well, he just sent me this white paper a 
few days ago. I can like, I can forward it to you.

And can you guys still hear me? Yep. Yep.

So then. Yeah, so he forwarded me the white paper. I looked at it, you know, to 
me, it wasn't as comprehensive as the vision that I had.

But I thought, you know, this is kids met, you know, right? Like, what are the 
chances that all this stuff lined up like this? So I said, yeah, make the intro.

And so we started a Skype group and, you know, Adam was there. I remember 
Charles was there. Vitalik was there.

I was there. It became the official Ethereum Skype group. It just kind of grew 
from there.

So, you know, it was like.

**Bob:** (16:00 - 16:01)
Was that Watercooler?

**Texture:** (16:02 - 16:04)
No, no, no. Watercooler was something I made later because.

**Bob:** (16:04 - 16:05)
That was later.

**Texture:** (16:05 - 16:27)
Yeah, so that was just the literal like main Ethereum Skype channel that we 
used to communicate for the first. I don't know. Long time.

Right. No, Watercooler was something I created later because. I actually don't 
remember why people.

I guess I was kind of like.

**Bob:** (16:27 - 16:30)
I guess it's off topic or whatever. Probably off topic chatty thing.

**Texture:** (16:30 - 16:49)
Maybe, but like I was kind of like the dude that everybody trusted. And so like 
whenever anybody wanted to talk to somebody, they would come talk to me. Which 
is why I got so much information about what was going on all the time.

But yeah, so I think it was just an extension of that. Like people talk to me 
all the time. Let me create a little place for us to shoot the shit.

**Bob:** (16:51 - 16:57)
So when when do you think you had that trip to Washington? When do you think 
that would have been?

**Texture:** (16:59 - 17:16)
I'm horrible with the time and dates, especially during that time. You know, 
when you're like a free flowing hippie dude. Yeah.

But I would say it was the week after. The week, week and a half after Vitalik 
sent the white paper out to.

**Bob:** (17:17 - 17:18)
Right, right.

**Texture:** (17:18 - 17:21)
His original group of people to get the feedback on.

**Bob:** (17:22 - 17:26)
Yeah, so it might even have been during November still.

**Texture:** (17:27 - 17:37)
Yeah. I mean, it was as early as you could get. I mean, just by happenstance, 
just by the timing, I was there.

The basically the moment we were coming together.

**Bob:** (17:38 - 17:59)
Yeah. It's amazing. Because, yeah.

So I was able to find that the video of you and Vitalik at the. At the salon. 
Yeah.

Which was beaming into the Vancouver Decentral there. And that was December the 
15th. That was.

Yeah. You did that one.

**Texture:** (18:00 - 18:10)
Yeah. So we've been. Yeah.

I mean, again, the timing, the timing, I don't know. But obviously by that time 
we had been doing it for a minute.

**Bob:** (18:11 - 18:25)
Yeah. I mean, the funny thing was looking at that. That's before there was any 
code.

Any public code, at least. There wasn't even any Python code from Vitalik 
published at that point. Gav and Jeff were weeks away still.

**Texture:** (18:25 - 18:33)
Yeah. And Jeff, to my understanding, just read the white paper and started 
coding it up on his own. And said, hey, I've got this go implementation.

**Bob:** (18:34 - 18:45)
Yeah. Pretty much. And the same for Gav.

They were both at the very tail end of December. Basically like a Christmas 
project kind of deal for the pair of them.

**Texture:** (18:45 - 19:06)
Yeah. No, it was great. And I'd been a developer my whole life since I was a 
kid.

And since I quit coding, I wasn't really sure where I fit in. But I was really 
happy when all these other people got in. I guess maybe if I'd have dropped 
some code and gotten a lot more ETH, that would have been cool.

But whatever.

**Bob:** (19:09 - 19:27)
So, I mean, to you at that point, what was Ethereum? What was this vision? And 
what were you thinking that that could unfold to be?

What was the kernel of that?

**Texture:** (19:28 - 21:00)
Yeah. So, I mean, it's so hard to remember those days. There's so much on top 
of it now.

I remember the general vibe was just a technology that would allow people to 
coordinate, to encode value. I mean, just at all dimensions. Things that 
haven't even come to fruition yet.

Things that people aren't even thinking about because so much of it has gone to 
scale. Fundraising, fundraising locally, just coordinating anything. I mean, it 
was just the whole world.

Just imagining every single system being replaced by this decentralized 
coordination structure that gives some 11-year-old kid in Bangalore could 
create the next technical development. And I think that kind of platform is 
just something that seemed really empowering. So, a lot of idealism.

Obviously, real life as it's played out is a lot messier and a lot different 
from how we imagined it. But a lot of idealistic things, a lot of just really 
coordination. And that's a really shitty description of the vision that I had 
because it was so deep and so multidimensional.

Yeah.

**Bob:** (21:02 - 21:05)
Social operating system is something I've seen you say on a few occasions.

**Texture:** (21:07 - 22:06)
Yeah. There's so many dimensions to it. A social operating system for allowing 
people to encode their values or encode their values, anything with value.

Creating incentive structures. Contracts that are enforced at the exact level 
that they were designed to. Which none of that sounds really technical and 
unsexy.

But to me, it was really about the impact. What happens when you empower people 
to be able to create value in their local communities or encode value in ways 
they haven't been able to? What happens when equity in your company can be 
easily traded?

Just all these things. What happens when you can do that to houses and local 
businesses and local communities?

**Bob:** (22:09 - 22:33)
Yeah. I mean, I think in my own sort of thinking in those early days, it was an 
awful lot about empowerment and about giving people the ability to control 
their own destiny, right? Yeah.

And something I repeatedly thought was like, if you think about the, what's it 
called? The pyramid of needs? What's it called?

I forget.

**Texture:** (22:34 - 22:35)
Maslow. The hierarchy.

**Bob:** (22:35 - 23:04)
Yeah. Maslow's. Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

I remember a number of times saying, it's frankly obscene given all the 
resources that we have in the world and how much more there is than was in 
previous years. It's obscene that people should be worried about housing or 
education or healthcare or just these basic things, right?

**Texture:** (23:04 - 23:04)
Yeah.

**Bob:** (23:04 - 23:32)
And how wonderful would it be if you could like yank up that base layer a 
little bit so that people are not like living in this fearful place of 
powerlessness. But instead can be like not worrying about that shit and not 
having to make these compromised bad decisions and everything. But just if you 
could do what you love, what a world that would be.

**Texture:** (23:33 - 24:36)
Yeah. And I'm a lot less idealistic about it now after the last decade for a 
lot of reasons. But the marshmallow test is real and you can create really good 
technologies and really good user experiences and as many guardrails as you can 
for people.

But at the end of the day, there's motherfuckers that are going to eat the 
marshmallow before they even hear the rules and then they'll do it again and 
again. It's not that I think the problems are unsolvable, but the idea that 
it's something from above being imposed down, despite the fact that the system 
seemed to be that way, I think a lot of it is just the level of complexity of 
modern life relative to the average intelligence. It's a wide gap and there's a 
lot of...

I mean, I could talk about that for fucking 10 hours too. Yeah.

**Bob:** (24:38 - 25:23)
Well, I mean, something that I saw in those early days of Ethereum as well was 
a real kind of almost like allergic reaction to anything that looked like 
organization or hierarchy or structure. You know, just like this total flip to 
the opposite side, right? Everything's got to be flat and open and, you know, 
everyone involved with everything, which is just completely impractical for 
actually organizing or doing anything.

Yeah, it's just nutty. But then it's like I realized it's like hierarchy isn't 
the problem. Being trapped in a hierarchy where it's to your detriment and you 
can't get out is the problem.

**Texture:** (25:24 - 28:17)
Yeah. And I think a lot of times what happens in that is smart people, you 
know, smart people, they don't really understand not smart people. And so what 
happens is we are born into a world where these pre-existing hierarchies exist 
and they, you know, to some degree or another, you know, kind of persisted 
through generation after generation.

And then we come in and we're like, why am I at the bottom of this hierarchy? 
I'm smart. We're all too smart for this.

And then they try to like, you know, they try to create new systems, assuming 
that everyone is approximately like them. And then, you know, I've been through 
so many because, again, coming through the hippie shit, I was in the Bay Area 
for a long time. You see so many people think that they're the first person to 
ever think of flat hierarchies and how it's going to be so much better.

And at the end of the day, man, like that's fine if you want to talk all the 
fucking time and you want to argue and you want to get nothing done. But at the 
end of the day, you know, a hierarchy is an information structure and it's also 
an accountability structure. And so as long as there's accountability at the 
top and as long as the information is flowing correctly and as long as the 
outputs are optimal to some degree, then it's the best you're going to get.

And it doesn't mean we can't continually improve. Obviously, life gets better 
and we have an obligation. You know, I think when you're creating things, it's 
not just the creating things.

And I think this is a big problem that still exists in crypto. People think if 
you build it, they will come. You can't just build it.

You have to build it and then you have to make it a button, a single button. It 
has to be so simple your grandma can do it and not destroy her life. And so it 
is this kind of perpetual attempt to take these complex structures, simplify 
them so that everyone has access to them.

But through that simplification, not creating these kind of hells that no one 
can get out of. And I think, you know, just because of the rate of 
technological development and the nature of economic progress, our 
opportunities as people trapped in those systems is to build new systems. But 
ultimately, we're going to come face to face with the reality of why those 
systems were set up the way they were and understand that the best we can 
really hope for in most instances is an optimization of that.

We can try to make it simpler, more efficient, better and more adaptable. But 
those are a lot of dimensions that any one of them out of out of sync is going 
to create either more problems or the system itself will collapse. Right.

And, you know, if the system doesn't exist, then nobody gets nobody gets 
anything.

**Bob:** (28:19 - 28:24)
Yeah. I mean, I guess it's a little bit analogous to sort of technical death 
and things in code.

**Texture:** (28:25 - 28:25)
Yep.

**Bob:** (28:25 - 28:39)
If you've got code and there's like, Jesus, look at this. It's so much like 
complexity and these conditions. I don't think we need any of that.

Let's just take all that out. But, you know, someone did that for a reason.

**Texture:** (28:39 - 28:39)
Yeah.

**Bob:** (28:39 - 28:56)
You may not know the reason, but, you know, it was done for a reason. And, you 
know, you're going to have some consequence if you if you do that. Right.

You can only be so simple without being, you know. Too simplistic and then you 
miss out on that.

**Texture:** (28:57 - 28:57)
Correct.

**Bob:** (28:57 - 28:58)
That detail.

**Texture:** (28:59 - 28:59)
Yeah.

**Bob:** (28:59 - 29:14)
I mean, I guess it's like, you know, with sort of U.S. legal stuff, you know, 
this this hot liquid might burn you or whatever. You just know that some shit's 
happened in the past. The reason that all of these things that happened is 
someone has done something really fucking stupid.

**Texture:** (29:15 - 30:03)
Yeah. And I, you know, as after I became a father, I became really a huge 
proponent of the idea of if you think a stupid rule exists because the person 
who made it is stupid. You haven't thought through the problem.

It isn't a bunch of people. I'm not saying this has never existed, but it's not 
like some nefarious guy at the top who wants to just ruin your life. It's some 
fucking idiot who did some idiot shit.

And then now you've got to make a stupid rule. You know what I mean? And you've 
got to enforce it with fire.

Otherwise, you know, your kids end up dumping plates of food in their closet 
and you find it six months later. And so, you know, it's just that at scale. 
But you're going to have to keep me on topic as much as you want to, because I 
am a meanderer.

**Bob:** (30:03 - 30:56)
Yeah. On this human side, something I talked about during my maple syrup piece 
phase was neurodiversity and the fact that normies would not be involved in the 
early phases of such a project. It's absolutely crazy to go and do what you did.

It's crazy what most people did. So how does that play out? The fact that in 
these frontier technologies, you don't have normal people.

Well, you do, but you have a lot of people who would not fall into that 
category. So how does that all play out? What do you think is happening there?

**Texture:** (30:56 - 35:50)
I think it's just the structure of how things have always occurred. Right. So 
you have these kind of people on the front edge.

And I was on the Internet from, you know, I remember reading when the HTML 2.0 
spec was about to come out. Right. And so the early days of the Internet, it 
was that.

And so I was on the Internet all day talking to people. And, you know, there 
was a technical barrier. And it's just you have these kind of neurodivergent 
people show up.

So in the early days of crypto, it was a lot of people who were paranoid, a lot 
of autistic people and a spattering of sociopaths who kind of could see that 
they could make money. And so that has a profound effect on how things play 
out. But I think it seems the way that at least in capitalism, what happens is 
huge amounts of capital come in and it just becomes this kind of probability 
matrix of throw as much energy at this thing as you can on the front end.

And then whatever survives is going to play out. But if you look at something 
like Linux or open source technology in general, it's very autistic. And 
autistic people have a very specific, I've noticed, differentiation from the 
average person, which is they honestly believe that the terminal is the 
greatest interface of all time.

It's like they don't grasp that most people need buttons. And so it's like you 
look at Linux. Linux was kind of a fringe thing only tech people used.

And then Google came in and at least had enough sense to hire some designers to 
turn it into something functional. Steve Jobs did the same thing with OSX. OSX 
was a previous Unix variant.

And so you need those people. You need those people who come in who are on the 
edge, who are technical enough to be able to communicate with the technical 
people and understand. But they also need the clout, the money and the power to 
overrule those people.

Because Linux had very horrible user interface and user experience for a long 
time, even when they had window managers. And you have to understand, I was a 
designer. So I would go into these open source spaces.

And I'm going to tell you what, man, these people who for sure would not let 
you comment on their code and for sure not let you tell you how they were going 
to structure it or for sure not tell them what language they were going to use 
have no fucking problem stepping outside of their code. They have no problem 
stepping outside of their own expertise and driving a designer insane. You know 
what I mean?

Very logical, unemotional, totally tapped out of any sense of what a normal 
person needs. And they just beat the designers into the ground. So you really 
need somebody who has power and the competence and the will and the desire and 
can put it all together.

And I don't think we really see that. The wallets fucking suck. I don't know 
now, but a year ago I clicked a button and emptied my hot wallet.

And that shouldn't be possible. How hard is it to throw up a fucking thing that 
says, hey, are you meaning to send every bit of this? This is a lot of money.

You know, like, why does it not just say, hey, it didn't even say it in 
dollars. Do you know what I mean? It was it was obfuscating.

It didn't even say there should have been a massive fucking pop up that said 
you're about to send $100,000 to somebody. Are you sure you want to do this? Or 
as soon as I clicked the button, knew what had happened.

Even if there had been like a fucking five minute delay. This isn't happening. 
And whether it be the structure of the organizations or if the designers are 
having an argument with the tech people, whatever it is, it's just grandma 
still can't use this shit.

It's 10 years in. No, no. That reduces it to an investment vehicle, right?

**Bob:** (35:50 - 35:51)
It does. It does.

**Texture:** (35:52 - 35:53)
And maybe it does.

**Bob:** (35:54 - 36:39)
That's really a failure, as you say, on delivery of the holistic platform that 
you do need something which is absolutely better. It's just like a product 
question, really, right? It's saying, unless the product that you are offering 
is absolutely better than something existing, or is cheaper or gives you some 
other benefits or whatever, then normal people are not going to use it.

Correct. It doesn't matter what your worldview is behind that. You've given 
them something that's worse than what they have, so they don't care.

Yeah.

**Texture:** (36:40 - 37:07)
And so I think exchanges and things like that kind of acting as a buffer, it's 
a step. Ultimately, how are these things going to be used? The end user is 
probably not going to know what they're using on the back end any more than the 
average person knows what processor is in their phone.

No.

**Bob:** (37:07 - 37:50)
I mean, I guess the hope is it's like a layering thing, right? That in the same 
way as you've got those DeFi primitives, that you're going to layer this 
whatever social recovery or buffered amounts or whatever, or insurance for 
fuck-ups or all this sort of stuff, right? You should be able to put together a 
stack of things that have an equivalent kind of characteristic and experience 
to existing things, but without that strong dependence on a single legal entity 
that's got that customer service provider kind of pattern, rather than just it 
being raw, dangerous, as you experienced there.

**Texture:** (37:50 - 38:01)
To this day, I feel anxious all the time because I hold crypto. Me, I feel 
anxious all the time.

**Bob:** (38:03 - 38:05)
I think we all do.

**Texture:** (38:05 - 38:44)
That's not an experience that the average person wants. The average person 
wants to put their money in a bank account. The average person wants to click a 
button and if something goes wrong, to be able to reverse it.

We haven't really addressed any of that. Again, it's a failure because the 
people who are in charge think anyone can do what they're doing and it's not 
that big of a deal. All you have to do is do this and blah, blah, blah.

All they have to do is click a button, you've done it. That's your metric for 
success. Click one button and not worry about anything.

You just know the thing is going to happen and if it doesn't, it'll get fixed.

**Bob:** (38:45 - 39:31)
Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, when I was looking through sort of different phases of 
this period that I've been covering in the early days of Ethereum website 
there, I was noticing. So, in January and February 2014, there's just such a 
flood of people that came in.

I mean, there were a fair chunk in December, but that just really accelerated 
through January and February. So, I mean, how did that play out that you just 
got tons and tons of people rocking up and really volunteering?

**Texture:** (39:33 - 41:37)
It turned everything into Game of Thrones. Yeah, that's what happened. It 
turned everything into Game of Thrones.

So, I was there day one. I was making sure like, you know, first thing I did 
was Vitalik posted this website that he made. It was piss yellow.

He had stolen some other shit coins logo and just put Ethereum on it. And I was 
like, please don't post this. Give me till tomorrow.

So, I like spun up a logo, sent it to him. He was like, oh, yeah, this is kind 
of what I was thinking. I was like, thank God.

Please don't put that out. I don't know if I made a website and then somebody 
submitted an image, but the image was like, and so just real quick, like what I 
used to do is I used to be like the dude who dev shops would call when they 
were six months behind on a project they needed done in three days. Right.

So, I was a designer, full stack developer. So, my skill was I could take your 
idea and I could make it look like it existed forever. And you had $10 million 
in funding in 24 hours.

Right. So, that was my goal at that point. Once I realized that that was a 
massive gap, I just inserted myself there.

And I'm only telling the story to say then when everybody flooded in and 
especially when the ZUG house happened, you had all these people kind of going 
behind other people's backs and trying to push people out and take over their 
roles. And it was just a very stressful, weird time because you just get a 
different type of person. Right.

The type of people who show up and are just wanting to build the thing because 
it's cool. That's the type of person. But when they show up and they're like, 
yeah, let's fucking, let's make sure it's us.

Let's make sure we're the ones. Let's like, fuck those people. Let's not 
communicate with them.

So, there was a lot of like political maneuvering that was required to survive.

**Bob:** (41:39 - 41:52)
Yeah. And I mean, I guess that Miami house was where that really dug in because 
that was the first time that most people were physically in the same location 
out of that set of people.

**Texture:** (41:52 - 46:18)
The weirdest part about that was meeting Charles. And, you know, Charles, he 
might have been the first person who is doing kind of the thing that I just 
said. Right.

Like, he just showed up and kind of inserted himself and was like, I'm going to 
be CEO. And I'm like, he was just he's just a fucking liar, though, man. He was 
like 24 or something.

25. And I kind of just sat back and didn't try to insert myself. I didn't try 
to like demand, you know, I'd be involved in this or that.

I just tried to kind of be as helpful as I could. So, you know, when I when I 
talked to Charles for the first time, I was like, all right, you know, this is 
kind of weird. Like, but we'll see what's up.

So like literally the moment I met him in Miami, I shook his hand and I was 
like, oh, God, he's a fucking sociopath. Like, OK, well, maybe he's our 
sociopath. You know, like every company has a sociopath.

Like maybe he's like a well-regulated sociopath. And then when we got to the 
Miami house, I found out, no, no, he's not a well-regulated sociopath. He's a 
fucking compulsive liar, manipulative weirdo.

Aaron, were you going to say something? I was just going to say in Charles' 
defense, at that time, he did look 50 years old. He'd go away with it.

But not under my name. So I guess to shield me from any sort of retribution. 
But it was weird, man.

He just said some weird shit to me. Like he showed me. I'll tell this one 
because I've told it publicly a lot of times.

But he was like, Texture, come here. And I'm like, what's up? And he's like, 
check out this text message.

And I'm like, OK. And I like just met the dude. And he shows me this text 
message.

And it's a chick. And she's like, I want to suck your cock so bad. Sorry for 
any children listening.

And I'm like, why the fuck is he showing me this? And he's like, you know where 
I met her? I was like, no.

He's like, I met her on the front lines of Afghanistan when I was working for 
DARPA. I'm like, Jesus Christ, dude. Oh, my God.

Shut the fuck up. And so I will say this because it's something that bothers 
me. Like for some reason, the media all says that the reason that Charles was 
kicked out was because he wanted to do business and not a nonprofit.

And Charles got kicked out because he was a fucking weirdo sociopath who didn't 
do anything above board and couldn't be trusted. He played games with 
everybody. I was not in his inner circle because I didn't.

I call him sociopath. We're like, they say something fucked up to see how you 
respond. They'll ask you to do unreasonable things to see if you'll do them.

And then the people that do them and do them without question end up being in 
his inner circle. They become the people which he's continued on in his 
Cardano. So like, you know, he he he just operates in such a way that he gets 
sycophants around him.

He lies to them. He gets them into situations where they're like loyal to him 
and they don't question them. And then, you know, just weaves a whole reality 
around that that isn't real.

And that's that that's my assessment of Charles. And he he was he was not 
kicked out because of business. Now, yeah, I mean, no one else was kicked out.

Let's just say that. I guess Amir left, but that's another story.

**Bob:** (46:19 - 46:29)
Well, Amir was kind of kicked out from what I saw based on the fact that people 
thought he wasn't actually doing anything. He wasn't really like pulling his 
weight or doing anything useful.

**Texture:** (46:29 - 46:37)
I like Amir as a person. We haven't talked to him in a few years. We're still 
cool to this day.

But yeah, I mean, what what was his skill set?

**Bob:** (46:39 - 47:01)
I don't know. There's Debbie sort of stuff. He said he was he was talking to 
people, potential investors sort of thing.

But yeah. Yeah. And I mean, in terms of Charles, it took me a lot of years to 
really understand Charles, shall we say.

Yeah.

**Texture:** (47:02 - 47:23)
You know, I defended you on that because I think you're like a really sweet guy 
and I think I understand your perspective. So whether or not I like Charles, 
I'm going to come defend you. Not to dig too much, but Charles is kind of like 
buddy, assistant, partner guy.

Is his name Jeremy? I'm remembering because I actually thought he was a Jeremy 
guy.

**Bob:** (47:23 - 47:23)
Jeremy Wood.

**Texture:** (47:24 - 47:57)
Yeah. And maybe there was more there. But I'm just to Texture's point, you 
know, maybe he was just naive or maybe he has no more than I do.

But that was sort of a strange dichotomy. Yeah. Again, I think it's just 
whoever would follow him around and not question him.

Like, that's how you got to be his right hand man. The less questions you ask, 
the closer, better friend you are, the more you listen to stupid stories. 
Didn't call him on it.

I mean, like I met this I was on the front lines of Afghanistan for DARPA. And 
now I'm like, shut the fuck up, Charles.

**Bob:** (48:01 - 48:05)
With Jeremy Wood, he notably called him boy. Come here, boy.

**Texture:** (48:06 - 50:42)
I never saw that. I'm telling you, like, I remember some story about him, like, 
playing games with people in the ZUG house, like sending somebody's sending 
somebody off who was like a wife was there a girlfriend and telling them that 
they had to go do this thing for him out of town. And then when that person had 
left, he then tried to convince one of the other dudes to, like, get with the 
dude's wife.

Like, just weird stuff, man. Like, just things that they're not that they have. 
Why would you do that?

You know what I mean? You have an opportunity of life. The answer is you're a 
fucking idiot who lied yourself into a situation you shouldn't be in.

And you are a compulsive lying manipulator. I'm sure it makes him feel smarter 
or something. I don't know.

But like, it was just the story that when he when he was gone after the red 
wedding, I think everybody breathed a sigh of relief. You know, the biggest 
problem for me was after the fundraiser, after the red wedding, Stephan, who I 
had introduced or I had welcomed into the organization. And again, there was a 
lot of political stuff.

If you went to the ZUG, you got basically put up in the hierarchy. So I ended 
up under Stephan. I couldn't go to ZUG because my girlfriend was pregnant and I 
couldn't leave to go to ZUG for a month.

And yeah, I don't know. Stephan was, I don't know, high energy, high anxiety 
dude. It was a weird thing.

He was smoking the stereotypical amount of cigarettes at the time. The 
stereotypical amount. That dude lived.

He had a vape that he puffed. Oh, you're right. It was a vape.

It was a vape. It was it was it was clouds of smoke. And so I went, you know, 
with DevCon Zero, I went and spent a week with them in the office in in London.

And dude, Stephan, if you weren't having a fucking panic attack, Stephan 
couldn't tell you were working. It was crazy. And he would pace around this 
co-working space like nobody else was there.

Just the whole place looked like a fucking rave, dude. I think he got kicked 
out because he was trying to film a TV show and vaping too much. And he had 
bought like $50,000 worth of camera equipment because his dream was to start a 
TV show or something.

On the Ethereum budget.

**Bob:** (50:47 - 50:52)
Yeah, I heard that London location was pretty special.

**Texture:** (50:52 - 50:53)
It was weird, man.

**Bob:** (50:57 - 50:59)
Did you say you were never in ZUG?

**Texture:** (51:00 - 51:43)
No, I never went. So my girlfriend at the time was pregnant. I had spent a 
month in Panama with Eric Voorhees and his team while she was pregnant.

So honestly, in retrospect, if I could go to ZUG, you know, it's hard to know 
how things would have played out because of the political stuff. I was not 
political. I didn't have any strategy.

I was not prepared for any of that shit. I just tried to be the most authentic, 
trustworthy, do what I say person. Good to everybody.

That's how I survived as long as I did. I don't really do politics. All that 
stuff was really weird.

**Bob:** (51:43 - 52:57)
I mean, all of this was prior to both the crowd sale and the formation of the 
Ethereum Foundation, right? So the red wedding was 3rd of June, 2014, where you 
had that, I guess, final decision of the foundation happening versus the 
for-profit. Because you had people coming, notably Antimedia Aurea, coming to 
ZUG at that point to sign papers, right?

It was to do with that Swiss legal entity. And then it was like, yep, no, we're 
not signing the papers. Big mess.

And then the foundation was July that that was incorporated. And you still have 
the crowd sale ongoing through July and August. So yeah, that was a hell of a 
long span of time.

**Texture:** (52:57 - 53:05)
Yeah. We kept saying two weeks. I don't know.

That was a meme for a very long time. Two weeks. Two weeks.

Two weeks.

**Bob:** (53:07 - 53:17)
Well, the website that was up at the time of the Miami conference was showing a 
countdown to the 1st of February. That was when the sales were going to start.

**Texture:** (53:17 - 53:45)
Yeah. And then, you know, I was with Vitalik when the sale was launched. We had 
hung out all day in San Francisco.

We were in the Westfield Mall in the food court. He needed Wi-Fi. And he was 
just sitting there and he just looked up at me and he goes, oh, the crowd sale 
went live.

Because that wasn't planned. I don't know if Taylor talked to you about that.

**Bob:** (53:48 - 53:50)
No. That was an accidental launch, was it?

**Texture:** (53:51 - 54:06)
It was an accident. I don't know. You'll have to ask Taylor about that.

But yeah, I guess he accidentally hit the button. Because, you know, it was 
legal. That's what kept happening.

They kept saying, we're waiting on legal. We're waiting on legal. We're waiting 
on legal.

Fuck legal, in retrospect.

**Bob:** (54:11 - 54:14)
So you and Kieran must have met each other a little bit.

**Texture:** (54:14 - 54:15)
Yeah.

**Bob:** (54:15 - 54:15)
At various times.

**Texture:** (54:16 - 54:25)
Yeah. We've actually hung out more probably in the last five years than we did 
back then. Yeah.

**Bob:** (54:27 - 54:34)
And I guess that Kieran, you saw more of that sort of New York-y legal side of 
things.

**Texture:** (54:34 - 59:09)
Yeah. Okay. This is a good tie-in point.

So, and Bob, at your request, of course, I was digging through the emails 
trying to piece together some pieces of the timeline, you know, yesterday, day 
before. So I had, I think by March, I was talking with Vitalik. And, you know, 
I was in academia at that time.

And he kind of found it useful to bounce like protocol, economic modeling stuff 
off, you know, like, I was like good at reading the white papers and understand 
what they were doing. I could, you know, kind of code at that time. I can still 
kind of code today.

But that's sort of, we ended up talking about like, how the thing should work 
at a, you know, theory protocol level more than an implementation level. And 
that kind of, I guess, in this was covered in the red wedding time, there was 
like, we, you know, a discussion of the usage of funds that ended up like on a 
whiteboard or something. And a lot of it was theoretically earmarks for a 
research group that meant to solve, you know, hard problems like scalability in 
crypto that, you know, like, in practice, people have sort of solved today.

And not by any of the means we imagined exactly. But, you know, they've been 
solved to some degree, at least, like with layer twos, for instance, 
scalability was very much anticipated as a problem. And, you know, it took a 
couple years, but you know, we have like $55 fees on NFT transfers at some 
point.

So I think Metallic sort of like, we talked about this for a little bit, and 
then he kind of like, blessed me as like the representative who's currently in 
academia, I started contacting people and trying to get them interested in 
Ethereum, and then doing like research related to it. In general, even like set 
a legal entity up for a separate research group. At some point, I'm trying to 
remember.

So Texture, we mostly work together just on the site, basically, like, I guess 
you were like, you know, web designer at that time, but I'm trying to remember. 
Yeah, I was doing web design. We had talked about the CRG, Cryptocurrency 
Research Group.

And I was like, that's cool. Let me build a website. I remember throwing, you 
know, faces on it, and then it just kind of uttered out, which, you know, it's, 
you know, like, it would have been a cool thing, fun thing.

I don't know. But also, there's a story about DeOreo not, anyways, I like, I 
didn't know people were getting paid for a long time. And I was like, living on 
my sister's love seat in her one bedroom apartment with my daughter because I 
was like, fucking homeless.

And working on Ethereum as much as I could, like multiple other jobs to try to 
make money. And DeOreo contacted me one day, because he was, you know, he was 
in the earlier days, like the primary contact that I would talk to the most. 
And he called me and he asked me for a favor.

And I was like, yeah, man, no problem. And I said, hey, by the way, if you, you 
know, like, listen, I'm in a bad spot right now. Is there any way I could get 
like back pay for 10 grand, which, you know, was not much.

And this dude just says, oh, no. And I was like, what the fuck? Anyways, I 
talked to Vitalik.

The way it goes back to the CRG is the CRG was supposed to pay me $5,000. So 
you owe me $5,000, Kieran. I don't know, you know, given that it was so early, 
if you could just pay me an ETH relative to the price at that time, that'd be 
sick.

Exactly. 20 cents was the presale price. Yeah, something like that.

So it'd be like quite the amount of ETH. Yeah, so just like 15,000 ETH and 
we'll call it even. All right.

All right.

**Bob:** (59:13 - 59:28)
But yeah, I mean, I guess, you know, many that was the case for many people 
through those months, you know, for some people that was nine, 10 months of 
unpaid contributions.

**Texture:** (59:29 - 59:43)
My memory is also that Anthony was the main force behind sort of quite stopping 
but delaying the funding to the CCRG. So like somehow we got it, some of it way 
later.

**Bob:** (59:43 - 59:43)
DRO.

**Texture:** (59:44 - 1:00:41)
DRO. Yeah. And it was like, not quite the original amount, but it was still 
some, but we were all like working on different things at that time.

So we ended up returning it, I think. But yeah, it was a strange, like, the 
strange delay that happened, I guess, like right after the presale. So before 
people are working, you know, uncompensated or largely uncompensated.

And then right after there was, I suppose, like a big cash grab going on. But 
maybe you know better than us. So there were a bunch of legal entities getting 
set up.

Like, there was like the Berlin dev company. And then there was another one, 
like in each, everyone tried to like, pull out as much of the pie as they 
could. But like, yeah.

Yeah, good.

**Bob:** (1:01:10 - 1:03:00)
I think you had Gav incorporating Ethereum dev in Berlin. Jeff in Amsterdam, 
though, that took quite a few months, more legalities to it. And there was an 
Ethereum in London as well.

Most of those FDev ones were kind of co-founded by Vitalik and Gav and Jeff and 
Mihai kind of group. Yeah, it was only the Toronto one there where it was that 
I could see Anthony was a director. I don't think he was ever a director on any 
of the other legal entities.

They were basically the, you know, the dev people and all Mihai and Taylor. But 
yeah, when you'd had the crowdsale and the Sviptung had been formed and then 
were the recipients of those funds, there was a whole power grab of a mess of 
how those funds went out and, you know, how that was done. And in Cryptopians, 
it talks about Gav maybe wanting to like grab all of the money straight into 
dev.

But then it's like, that's probably not legal and it's probably not a good idea 
either. And Joe wanting to do it sort of a milestone based slow delivery, which 
I think what it sort of ended up being. But you did have this sort of weird 
situation where you'd say, oh, do you work for the Ethereum Foundation?

But very few people actually work for the Ethereum Foundation. Most people were 
actually working as staff or contractors for these for profit legal entities, 
which were sort of doing the work.

**Texture:** (1:03:02 - 1:03:24)
Yeah, I think I guess they must have got it kind of like having now run a 
business for a long time, you got to set up sensible contracts and IP 
agreements. And or, you know, sometimes that looks like an intercompany 
agreement. And then, you know, if you do it in the buttoned up way, there's 
like a lot of headache associated with such things.

**Bob:** (1:03:26 - 1:03:28)
I think it was a lot looser than that.

**Texture:** (1:03:28 - 1:03:41)
I have a strong memory. Yes, of like a, let's just put all the money in this 
other legal entity discussion going on, like during the whole red wedding week. 
So, yes.

**Bob:** (1:03:42 - 1:04:09)
Yes. And yes, the majority of those legal entities have since been shut down. 
That was something that Ming did over the course of her time was tidy up all of 
this like corporate mess that was maybe not really required in the first place.

But yeah, I mean, good.

**Texture:** (1:04:11 - 1:04:19)
They could have just worked for the foundation, but I guess they didn't they 
didn't want to be in Switzerland, which maybe was part of it. And I remember it.

**Bob:** (1:04:21 - 1:04:34)
Well, this was another funny thing. Right. With the with the spaceship was that 
there was an expectation at the start that it was going to be a lot of 
development work happening in Switzerland as well.

And then that never happened.

**Texture:** (1:04:35 - 1:07:58)
Also, it it kind of goes against the Charles was fired for wanting to make it 
corporate when every single person filed their own corporate legal entity in an 
attempt to divert the funds to their own personal power structure. Yeah, I'll, 
I'll, I'll add, because I was in the room for some of this, Gavin immediately 
started talking about brain drain when there was to be no crypto Google. So I 
guess like they for for a long time, they wanted to do hybrid for profit, 
nonprofit.

And you know, the protocol sits in the not for profit. And you know, for profit 
tries to commercialize and yada, yada, yada. And of course, in the end, 
everyone's like the tokens were worth more than probably any equity would have 
ever been worth.

Yeah, but, but yeah, I think, I think the it's definitely a mix of factors. I 
think it's primarily what you said, but also, you know, like, the, I think, 
while there's just a grossness to Charles, like, I guess, okay, with records 
on, I think there was also a dev guy, business guy divide. That, to your point 
on like the autists, right?

You know, not that they were great at business, like a mirror Charles, but 
there was more of a, like, what do you do? And some of what they did was like, 
try to set up deals with the Council of zoo and then do like other business 
developments, etc. That kind of was lost afterwards.

I'm not saying it was all that effective in their hands. But there was this, 
like, BD commercialization gap. And so yeah, to your point, everyone then 
started their own companies, ConsenSys being the most successful of them and 
kind of building that business guy plus commercialization role from there on.

You're saying the guy with the most business experience did the best? So it 
seems. What's funny?

When I met your dad in the Miami house, I just thought he was somebody's dad. I 
mean, obviously, in retrospect, he was yours, but I didn't know that he would 
go on to become Joe Lubin. You know, I just remember, like, shooting shit with 
them and talking to him about thoughts and stuff.

And he was real, like, quiet and, you know, told me about his time making music 
videos in Jamaica or whatever. Yeah, that was right after that. He also, for a 
time, he believed that he would be a software developer for Ethereum.

And then I guess he realized, like, no one knew anything about business. And, 
you know, he'd done a tour in corporate from the IT side and then run a hedge 
fund. So he most understood how things worked.

Yeah, much better than everyone else. I knew how to exist in a fucking early 
stage startup because I'd been doing that for 10 years over and over. So my 
major contribution was not saying, have you guys ever heard of a four year 
vesting period?

I thought it a bunch and I was like, I don't want to be here for four years. 
I'm not going to say that shit.

**Bob:** (1:08:00 - 1:09:01)
Yeah, I mean, it's something which I've seen people comment on a fair bit is, 
you know, the early contributor slice, which was 9.9% of the ether, which was 
shared between the people who did contribute over those of emulants, 10 months 
or so, is equal to the amount that the Ethereum Foundation received. So, you 
know, all of the developments of everything which happened after that July to 
the current day has had that same bucket. And, you know, that is not a typical 
kind of setup for, you know, long term success.

Talking about the vesting, you know, that as I look through a lot of these 
early people, you know, they did their part and they moved on.

**Texture:** (1:09:02 - 1:09:02)
Yeah.

**Bob:** (1:09:02 - 1:09:06)
But it would be nice if some people hung around some more.

**Texture:** (1:09:06 - 1:09:30)
Yeah, I mean, I think to some degree, that's why I'm still here in this space, 
that and the guilt of learning what people do with the things you create and 
feeling some sort of like responsibility to kind of try to nudge in a 
direction, you know, but balancing that with my desire to be anonymous to the 
most degree that I can was difficult.

**Bob:** (1:09:32 - 1:09:47)
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. I mean, it was something which came up, I think, through 
sort of 2018, 2019 as well was the Foundation stiffing developers, essentially.

**Texture:** (1:09:48 - 1:09:51)
Yeah, I don't know. That didn't happen to me, praise the Dalit.

**Bob:** (1:09:53 - 1:10:24)
No, no. It's alright for you early guys. But yeah, what else they have noted?

Yeah. Something which you've spoken about a little bit on Twitter as well is 
sort of like purges and palace politics and so on. Can you speak a little bit 
to about like the nature of the Foundation and the opaque nature of it and 
these kind of palace politics that you have going on?

Like what's happening there?

**Texture:** (1:10:25 - 1:10:28)
You mean, in the last 10 years?

**Bob:** (1:10:30 - 1:10:46)
Right, right. I mean, this is quite a contrast, right? In your Coinbase 
article, you were speaking about the contrast, right, between the, you know, 
your open, decentralized, collaborative space and the Foundation as an entity.

**Texture:** (1:10:46 - 1:19:42)
Yeah, so I think that it's difficult because if you look at, you know, this is 
my personal assessment, how I think about the situation. If you look at the 
early days, and you take all that political shit seriously, and you realize 
that Metallic's basically like a 18 year old kid in the middle of this, like, I 
was underprepared for the political shit, but I wasn't even like the center of 
it, you know. Metallic had to be pushed into this weird situation where all of 
these sharks and snakes were around and where Charles is acting some type of 
way.

And then everyone else around him is vying for power. And that's a lot of 
stress, right? And so if I was thinking of it from Metallic's perspective, to 
me, my primary goal for myself would be to insulate myself from those political 
games to the greatest degree possible, right?

And so, you know, in some ways, it's kind of like the requirement to stay sane 
and the requirement to insulate yourself from people playing these games and 
trying to get to you is that you kind of have to anoint yourself king and do 
the thing that Charles did, which is surround yourself with people who are 
going to basically have like fealty to you, right? They're not there because 
they're trying to manipulate you or get one over on you. They're not there 
because, you know, they're not playing games behind your back that you're going 
to have to deal with.

And I think that if you're trying to focus on your goal, you know, in this kind 
of like foundational structure, I just assume that every decision that's been 
made in the structure of the foundation is based on kind of two principles. One 
is kind of the amorphous notion that like a decentralized project shouldn't 
have a centralized control structure. And, you know, there's really some sort 
of kind of suicide urge that I see in the way that they structure it.

Like it could be an organization that exists for, you know, a thousand years if 
they organize it correctly, but they're trying as hard as they can, it seems, 
to make it disappear. And I think that that's like incredibly misguided. I 
don't think there's any historical examples of anything like that happening.

And I think that if the foundation disappeared tomorrow, then all those power 
game, you know, the power vacuum would just create fucking infinity of those 
power games until somebody stepped up and, you know, Ethereum becomes whatever 
the person who can kind of get that power position. So I think that 
unfortunately, from my assessment, Vitalik's need to keep himself sane and 
protected has not been done in such a way that the Ethereum Foundation 
necessarily serves the long term survival of Ethereum. Just like that's a major 
concern for me.

So I don't, I don't think a lot of people might criticize the way it's 
structured for reasons like, but I understand, man, like I'm not Vitalik and 
I've had to deal with, you know, those power games and they drive you crazy, 
man. They get in your way. They keep you from being able to focus on what you 
want to focus on.

And I think not coming up through the traditional kind of like Silicon Valley 
group, you know, when you when you come up in that you're surrounded by people 
who have been in it and have survived for a long time and they understand how 
they understand how to support founders and they understand how to legally 
orchestrate these things. And I just don't think that he had those people 
around him to protect him. You know, so I don't know.

Kieran, you got something to say? You know, I wanted to compare Ethereum with 
Bitcoin, which I've, you know, seen some of the similar governance issues on 
Bitcoin, but it's different. Like right now, it feels pretty technologically 
stagnant.

At a time, I knew a bunch of the core devs. We had like a funny meetup once at 
like a Berkeley restaurant, and a couple of them showed up. And it's, you know, 
Bitcoin technologically just doesn't really change.

But there was a time where people were kind of, it was a foundation and they 
were acting in a coordinated manner to popularize Bitcoin and so on. And now it 
feels like those people are largely gone. There's a lot of the work that adds 
functionality that Bitcoin uses Ethereum or an L2 or an EVM or what have you.

And people are just kind of focused on the price act, pretty much. And that's 
been, I think, a benefit to Bitcoin. But I guess, like, I think Satoshi kind of 
went through something similar.

And, you know, I think he was starting to get pretty irritated from, there's a 
good book covering his Bitcoin talk posts, and, you know, how that started to 
feel over time. And then obviously, he disappeared when he disappeared. I'm 
just thinking, like, is the Ethereum way better?

I think, like, probably it is. It's not optimal for sure. Like, later projects 
run much closer to Silicon Valley tech companies and, like, have the open 
source part where the open source parses but are pretty strongly governed, so 
far as I can tell.

But I think, I also say, like, there's probably some merit to the approach. 
Like, it was so decentralized that lots of people could come in and try to make 
it their own. And that there was a plus to that, too.

And just the downside being the chaos. I don't know. What do you think about 
this question?

Yeah, I mean, I think, can you hear me? My little thing is not showing. You're 
good.

Okay. Yeah, no, I think, you know, as far as the foundation being set up in the 
beginning, it's whatever. What it's become is whatever, too, because they could 
change into a structure that supports Ethereum for the long term.

But, yeah, I'm more focused on today. But I do think, you know, I always thank 
your dad every time I see him for all of his work because I do think he's 
filling a role. And if there is a power vacuum, you know, I think he will be 
standing around to at least mitigate it.

Without him, who knows. But the thing about the Bitcoin thing you said is like, 
that's what I'm concerned is going to happen to Ethereum as you get to a point 
where it just becomes this kind of like, not coordinated thing where 
everybody's arguing and nothing happens. Right.

And nobody can make a decision. Because at the end of the day, like, groups 
don't make decisions, you know, groups don't create greatness. Like, that's 
just, that's just not what happens.

You know, like, you have these kind of visionary geniuses and if they manage 
to, like, find the right idea and the right group and they're supported and 
they have the time and energy to do it, then it moves forward. You can even 
look at like a more structured version like Apple, whereas, you know, Steve 
Jobs had set up a massive corporate structure and it still exists to this day 
and the vision is gone. Right.

So once the kind of visionary is separated from the vision and once the, you 
know, it's going to default back to the level of the organization. And if the 
goal of the Ethereum Foundation as stated is to make itself irrelevant, like, I 
mean, that's so frustrating. Like, man, we created this technology that could 
potentially allow you to, it could, it could potentially allow, this technology 
could potentially allow you to create entire governance systems and corporate 
structures or whatever that could persist on the blockchain indefinitely with 
all kinds of mechanisms.

And like, what the fuck? Like, is that not what the Ethereum Foundation should 
be doing? Should they not be like eating their own dog food?

Should they not be doing what we said we were going to do? Should they not be 
funding that? Like, I mean, how many esoteric scaling solutions can you, can 
you invest in?

Right.

**Bob:** (1:19:46 - 1:20:44)
Yeah, I mean, I, from my perspective, I think the change of leadership that 
there was this year with Thomas coming in as a co-ED has made a world of 
difference, you know, that they have become more transparent than has been the 
case before. And I think that he as a Ethereum company CEO, because he's the 
CEO of Nevermind as well, I think has given him that kind of like product 
holistic, getting shit done kind of perspective that hasn't before. And he's 
got the credibility of having been in the ecosystem as well.

Right. And having gone from, hey, we're a, we're a, you know, we're a little 
company doing an Ethereum client to, you know, a really large kind of player 
that do all kinds of things.

**Texture:** (1:20:45 - 1:20:45)
Yeah.

**Bob:** (1:20:45 - 1:20:49)
And I think there hasn't been that before. You know, he is a CEO type.

**Texture:** (1:20:50 - 1:21:25)
He, he was, I did a call with him. We talked for a bit and he seemed great. 
Asked a lot of questions and said he talked to over 100 people and I gave him 
some of my thoughts and criticisms.

And I don't know, I've seen a lot of the things that we talked about kind of 
playing out. So, you know, I hope, I hope he can be a force that persists. 
Again, you know, if you have the palace politics, there's always the, people 
like that, they're always in danger.

**Bob:** (1:21:28 - 1:21:29)
There might be another coup.

**Texture:** (1:21:29 - 1:23:18)
That's what I'm saying. Like, you know, you could be the best guy with the best 
intentions, with the best ideas and you're the guy to do it. And if, if the 
power structure is designed around, you know, placating people who are only 
concerned about their place in the palace, you know, it's happened to me 
multiple times in my life.

They kick you, they kick you out because you're a threat to what they're trying 
to accomplish in their minds. They don't understand that, you know, if you 
allow the guy, the guy who is doing this to, to really create something that 
lasts and is bigger than you're going to get a bigger piece of, a bigger slice 
from a bigger pie. But if you completely undermine everybody who's trying to do 
that, then you're going to end up with a nothing, you know.

There's a mechanism for a coup. I assume like in practice, the foundation is 
like, you know, kind of doing whatever the people who work for it wants to do, 
but in the end is a dictatorship of Vitalik at the end of the day. Like, yeah.

Yeah. The only mechanism I see is the people who have Vitalik's ear get in his 
ear long enough that, you know, it's not working. So to some degree there, 
there might be a community capacity to be a louder voice consistently to ensure 
that, you know, there will be backlash if anything like that happens.

**Bob:** (1:23:21 - 1:24:01)
Yeah. I make this the, the sick epoch that there's been. So we have white paper 
to red, red, red wedding, whereas essentially, you know, just no formal 
structures really, you know, emergent.

Then you have the period of the, of the Ethereum Foundation and FDev. So that 
was July 2014 through February 2015. Then you have the interregnum where you, 
you were whopped, which was between March 2015 and June 2015, where you had 
Kelly.

**Texture:** (1:24:04 - 1:24:05)
Becker.

**Bob:** (1:24:06 - 1:24:47)
Kelly Becker kind of like overseeing the installation of the new professional 
in quotes board that began the Ming dynasty where she immediately knocked off 
all the other directors. And then she had her three years of, of tyranny. And 
then you had the infinite garden with Aya coming in, in the, another coup there 
in February 2018.

And then it seems this, this last one was maybe not so much of a coup as an 
evolution in that Aya's still around as the president, but you have new 
executive leadership.

**Texture:** (1:24:48 - 1:24:48)
Yeah.

**Bob:** (1:24:48 - 1:24:51)
So, yeah, I don't know what this period comes to be called.

**Texture:** (1:24:51 - 1:27:19)
It's definitely better and more coherent. You know, I, I'm prescient a lot of 
the time and, you know, I had my encounters with Aya that clued me into the 
fact that she was not really qualified or even coherently involved in a way 
that I would assume somebody in her position will be. So I was, you know, I was 
applying pressure years ago, years and years ago.

And yeah, five years ago, six years ago. So I think, you know, eventually the 
community kind of came around to what I've been saying this whole time, which 
is, wait, like she should be doing like there's things that need to be done and 
we all see that they're not being done. And what the fuck?

And we can't even, this woman is, doesn't seem to care. And she keeps talking 
about esoteric poetry and fucking infinite gardens. What is this shit?

You know, like fucking do your job. Like, you know, for me, you know, I've 
talked about it before, but, you know, their website, the website was like the 
same website for three years. It was just an informational website.

It was a brochure website. And I just messaged her and said, hey, man, we need 
to update this website. I'll do it for free.

And she said, oh, yeah, I think we have a team working on that. Let me get back 
to you. So I like kept in contact with her.

It took her six months, six months to figure out who was working on the 
website, Bob. I mean, like, are you fucking kidding me? Like, what are you 
doing?

Are you sitting at the beach? Like sipping my ties? I legitimately don't know 
what you're doing because you clearly have no active.

This is how this is what it should be. You should have an org chart. You should 
fucking know the person to call.

You know, you should actually know who's building your website. So that was 
that was just an insane to me that you could be the ostensible. Yeah, we're 
running an organization and not even know who to contact to to see who is 
building the website.

And then it ultimately was Josh Stark. I messaged him, said, hey, man, I'd love 
to help. I'll do it for free.

I can have it done in a week. He was like, no, I'm good. Like, what do you mean 
you're good?

You're not doing it like nothing has happened. It's been six months. It's not 
something that takes six months or a year.

**Bob:** (1:27:19 - 1:28:52)
It was a longer tweet thread of me ranting a little bit. Well, it wasn't very 
ranty. Actually, it was quite polite in in late in late.

It was December 2017. And Hudson tweeted out something like, hey, what could 
the Ethereum be doing better? It was like that.

And it's like, ah, well, I don't know. Well, oh, my God. But but my list was 
very simple.

It was like, yeah, the website ships useless, doesn't do anything. There's no 
information, nothing of that, you know, nothing useful there. Also, there's no 
public information on the Ethereum Foundation.

Like, you know, who are the board members? You know, how does voting work? Who 
are advisors to the foundation?

Yeah. What teams are there? Who works on these teams?

There wasn't even a grants program at that point, either. It was just basically 
you just have Ming and Vitalik. And she had hired on Jamie Pitts and Hudson.

So there was a little bit of extra help. But essentially, it was it was that 
thin little bit of overhead and a bunch of devs. And that that was what there 
was.

So and she couldn't delegate either Ming. So just nothing got done. Like really 
just nothing got done at all.

Yeah.

**Texture:** (1:28:53 - 1:29:17)
I mean, I don't know, in retrospect, if I'd known that. I mean, I know you said 
she was a nightmare, but she did offer to hire me back into the Ethereum 
Foundation. But I didn't feel it was a time where I didn't really feel like 
working.

I've been a little burnt out from the previous few years. So, yeah, you know, 
maybe if I'd have accepted that.

**Bob:** (1:29:19 - 1:29:24)
She should have Ming'd you. Don't worry, you wouldn't have lasted long if she 
came back.

**Texture:** (1:29:24 - 1:29:35)
Maybe, maybe, maybe, you know. Everyone got Ming'd. If she was like Stefan, 
then yeah, that high energy, like stress stuff.

But I don't know. I was a little bit more.

**Bob:** (1:29:35 - 1:29:58)
But yeah, I mean, you know, so I think that was the problem, like that you 
hadn't got enough people to get anything done, you know, like like what you 
talked about with Aya. That was that was the case in that earlier year as well. 
There wasn't really no organizational structure and nothing really much was 
happening beyond the developers doing their development.

Oh, and they will do a DevCon now and then.

**Texture:** (1:29:58 - 1:31:21)
Yeah. Well, you asked about the palace politics thing and I just had a memory. 
You know, people, it's much less now than it used to be.

But to some degree, people still keep me in the loop when, you know, they know 
things. So I think maybe the biggest problem with the with the way that things 
are structured right now is that there is nobody to give pushback. And there's 
no dissenting voices.

And there's a like a very homogenous group of people. Homogenous, whatever it 
was, a group of people who aren't going to step out of the party line for any 
reason because they're going to be afraid of being pushed out. And I think 
that's not necessarily good.

Obviously, you can't have people following you around who think their only job 
is to undermine anything you say. But really, I mean, you need you need voices 
that will speak the truth, even when it's uncomfortable, because, you know, 
decisions they have they have outcomes. And having a bunch of people who see 
the world in the same way and aren't really thinking of things holistically or 
from different perspectives, you know, it's going to create issues.

**Bob:** (1:31:24 - 1:31:42)
At the recent FCC in Cannes, there was a slide which Jerome had on there, which 
was talking about dissenting voices. And both myself and Greg Colvin were up 
there as as Ethereum dissidents.

**Texture:** (1:31:43 - 1:31:47)
I didn't get it. It's all right. Nobody remembers me.

Congrats, though.

**Bob:** (1:31:47 - 1:31:52)
No, sorry. You're not. You're not known enough.

I don't know.

**Texture:** (1:31:52 - 1:31:52)
Oh, no.

**Bob:** (1:31:52 - 1:31:54)
You're not. You're not being loud enough.

**Texture:** (1:31:55 - 1:32:11)
No, it's all right. I only have the number of followers I do because a couple 
of jokes I made, one of them being Petra Pong Sai. I very much don't mind being 
lost to history if it means I'm not on someone's let's rob the sky list.

**Bob:** (1:32:17 - 1:32:20)
Well, I think that's maybe a good kind of place to wrap up.

**Texture:** (1:32:20 - 1:32:21)
Yeah, don't.

**Bob:** (1:32:21 - 1:32:28)
I wish you all the very best and enjoy your life.

**Texture:** (1:32:29 - 1:32:45)
Yeah. Well, Bob, thanks for having me on. If you want to have me on again, I'm 
more than happy to always give you my time.

Good to talk to you, Kieran. A pleasure. It had been not too long, but no.

Yeah.

**Bob:** (1:32:45 - 1:32:46)
Great.

**Texture:** (1:32:46 - 1:32:58)
Great to chat again. And we'll do again soon. Yeah, maybe.

Maybe so. Maybe we'll see you soon. And then thanks for everybody who's come to 
listen.

And yeah. Don't follow me.

**Bob:** (1:32:58 - 1:33:10)
OK. Thanks a lot. So, yeah.

Texture is I am Texture on Twitter. Have you got any other websites or 
anything, places that you'd like to point people?

**Texture:** (1:33:11 - 1:33:19)
No, I'm not. No. Just have a nice night.

Have a nice day. Wherever you're at morning.

**Bob:** (1:33:21 - 1:33:23)
Thanks so much. OK.

**Texture:** (1:33:23 - 1:33:25)
Cheers, everyone. Bye.
