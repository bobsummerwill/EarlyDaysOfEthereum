*Helped bring Mist to life, the first Ethereum dApp browser, that integrated the Ethereum blockchain network to Web applications. With an intuitive interface, it raised the bar for the overall Ethereum ecosystem. Mist had more than 5M downloads and fulfilled its mission. The browser opened the way for other players like Samsung, Opera and Brave, each had their own blockchain-enabled browsers.*

*Led the development of Ethereum Grid, a GUI for Ethereum clients.*
