[Yann Levreau](/people/yann-levreau) built AlethZero as an early attempt at a Mist-style browser before [Fabian Vogelsteller](/people/fabian-vogelsteller/) restarted that effort in JavaScript.

In [Fabian Vogelsteller's Early Days of Ethereum interview](/videos/episode012-fabian-vogelsteller/), [Bob Summerwill](/people/bob-summerwill/) described AlethZero as "a really ugly programmer tool, kind of like a million controls", and Fabian agreed it was "that early Mist browser."  The experience of AlethZero informed the decision to rebuild Mist as a JavaScript/Electron application.
