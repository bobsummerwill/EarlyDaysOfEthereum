Nora is an unknown individual who seemingly gave [Ming Chan]({{ '/people/ming-chan/' | relative_url }}) legal advice related to her hostile takeover of the EF from the other newly elected board members.

Here is a Skype message which [Ming Chan]({{ '/people/ming-chan/' | relative_url }}) accidentally sent to [Lars Klawitter]({{ '/people/lars-klawitter/' | relative_url }}) on 4th August 2015.  She deleted it almost immediately afterwards, but not before he took a copy.  It is assumed that it was intended for her sister and legal counsel [Tung Chan]({{ '/people/tung-chan/' | relative_url }}).  Bumper Chan was her Skype name.  Her first official day as Executive Director had been just a few days earlier, on 1st August 2015.

*[04/08/2015 20:05:15] Bumper Chan: [Wayne]({{ '/people/wayne-hennessy-barrett/' | relative_url }}) is dismissive of everyone, including the other board members. He says he will handle everything. It sounds like [Wayne]({{ '/people/wayne-hennessy-barrett/' | relative_url }}) convinced [Lars]({{ '/people/lars-klawitter/' | relative_url }}) to write this letter. [Wayne]({{ '/people/wayne-hennessy-barrett/' | relative_url }}) told me "You're not going anywhere" and neither is anyone else*

*[04/08/2015 20:06:07] Bumper Chan: He is worse than [Vadim]({{ '/people/vadim-levitin/' | relative_url }}).*

*[04/08/2015 20:06:49] Bumper Chan: Thankfully Nora believes I can gain control together with [Vitalik]({{ '/people/vitalik-buterin/' | relative_url }}), with your help to walk me through it*

*[04/08/2015 20:08:37] Bumper Chan: She described a scenario later, where I could, if I wanted, become Pres of the Board, with [Vitalik]({{ '/people/vitalik-buterin/' | relative_url }}) as Chairman. Also, she let me know I can choose my own advisory board (not [Kelley]({{ '/people/kelley-becker/' | relative_url }})).*

*I had so little time with her, but she did say this is not a good situation and sounds like a hostile (board) situation.*

This episode was described in [The Cryptopians](https://www.amazon.ca/Cryptopians-Idealism-Greed-Making-Cryptocurrency/dp/1541763017/) by [Laura Shin]({{ '/people/laura-shin/' | relative_url }}) in 2022, but to this day nobody has discovered who "Nora" actually is.  The only people who would probably know would be [Ming]({{ '/people/ming-chan/' | relative_url }}) and [Tung]({{ '/people/tung-chan/' | relative_url }}), but they don't want to talk, unsurprisingly.
