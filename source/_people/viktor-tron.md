Viktor started work on Ethereum in February 2014, with a commit to cpp-ethereum on 26th February 2014 and and edit to the White Paper on the Github wiki on 27th February 2014.

He was later hired by Jeff Wilcke through ETH DEV CIC in October 2014.

Ethersphere was created in March 2014 by Daniel Nagy and Viktor Trón (maybe?), primarily as an umbrella for their Swarm development activities.  Swarm development was originally part of the ongoing Geth development.

Viktor will have left the Ethereum Foundation in late 2015, at the same time as Daniel Nagy, when Swarm work was defunded by the Ethereum Foundation under financial pressure.  The Swarm Foundation was founded much later.

Swarm work continues to the present day.
