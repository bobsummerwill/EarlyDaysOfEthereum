Christian Reitwießner was the lead developer of [Solidity](/articles/solidity/), Ethereum's primary smart contract programming language, which he designed alongside [Gavin Wood](/people/gavin-wood/). He joined the Ethereum Foundation in October 2014 and was based in the Berlin ETHDEV office, where he worked for nearly a decade.

Fabian Vogelsteller, who sat in the same Berlin office building the [Mist](/articles/mist/) browser and [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js), described working closely with him:

> "I talked and worked with Christian a lot who worked on Solidity, was also in the Berlin office." — Fabian Vogelsteller ([Episode 12](/videos/episode012-fabian-vogelsteller/))

At DEVCON3 in Cancún (November 2017), Christian was introduced alongside Vitalik Buterin, Peter Szilagyi, Fabian Vogelsteller, and Viktor Tron as one of the Ethereum team leads.
