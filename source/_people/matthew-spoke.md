Matthew Spoke was the founder of Nuco (later [Aion](https://aion.theoan.com/)), one of the earliest companies exploring enterprise uses of Ethereum. He was a key participant in the proto-enterprise Ethereum community that predated the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](/articles/enterprise-ethereum-alliance/).

Spoke was part of an early Slack group hosted by the Ethereum Foundation where enterprise-minded developers and companies — including Clearmatics, AMIS, and others — discussed business applications of Ethereum technology. This group, alongside a parallel effort driven by [ConsenSys](/articles/consensys/) connections, eventually merged into the founding membership of the EEA.
