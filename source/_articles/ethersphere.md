title: Ethersphere
description: "GitHub organization for Swarm development"
---

Ethersphere was created in March 2014 by Daniel Nagy and Viktor Trón (maybe?), primarily as an umbrella for their Swarm development activities.  As far as I can determine, it was never a legal entity.

Daniel was a contractor for ETHDEV from October, and Viktor was the first employee of the Ethereum Foundation, being hired by Jeff Wilcke in February 2014.

Here is the [Github organization](https://github.com/ethersphere).
