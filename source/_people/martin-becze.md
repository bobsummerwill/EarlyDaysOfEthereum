Martin Becze was an early Ethereum core developer who built the Node.js Ethereum client and created the [EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposals)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs) repository—the framework through which Ethereum standards like [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) would be proposed and formalized.

At [DEVCON0](/articles/devcon0/) in November 2014, Martin participated in the client panel discussion alongside Gavin Wood (C++), Jeff Wilcke (Go), and Heiko Hees (Python), representing the Node-Ethereum implementation.

Fabian Vogelsteller credited the EIP repository as the catalyst for formalizing the ERC-20 token standard:

> "Martin Becze before created the EIP repository and I think Gavin or whatever mentioned like, where do we do the standardization? And I think he mentioned, yeah, we have the EIP repository. That would be the right place." — Fabian Vogelsteller ([Episode 12](/videos/episode012-fabian-vogelsteller/))
