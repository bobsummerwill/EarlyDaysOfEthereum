# Back story

This is a continuation of a 2017/2018 project in which [Bob Summerwill](https://bobsummerwill.com/about) gathered information on the early contributors to the [Ethereum project](https://ethereum.org) and of people who were involved with the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/) in its early years:

- [Ethereum Foundation People](https://bobsummerwill.com/ethereum-foundation-people/) - released 31st March 2018 ([X post](https://x.com/BobSummerwill/status/980328322625290240))
- [Ethereum Foundation Timeline](https://bobsummerwill.com/ethereum-foundation-timeline/) - released 4th May 2018 ([X post](https://x.com/BobSummerwill/status/992382419289411585))

The time range which Bob detailed was from November 2013, when [Vitalik Buterin](https://x.com/vitalikbuterin) released the whitepaper, until 31st January 2018 when [Ming Chan left the EF](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/01/31/to-infinity-and-beyond) and [Aya Miyaguchi was announced](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/01/31/farewell-and-welcome) as the new Executive Director.

Since the original information was first published, three books have been written on the history of Ethereum, which give a fuller story:

- [Out of The Ether](https://www.amazon.ca/Future-Money-Ethereum-Foundation-Revolution/dp/1119602939) by [Matthew Leising](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-leising-5278b85/)
- [The Infinite Machine](https://www.amazon.ca/Infinite-Machine-Crypto-hackers-Building-Internet/dp/0062886142/) – [Camila Russo](https://x.com/CamiRusso)
- [The Cryptopians](https://www.amazon.ca/Cryptopians-Idealism-Greed-Making-Cryptocurrency/dp/1541763017/) – [Laura Shin](https://x.com/laurashin)

The "Early Days of Ethereum" videos were independently produced by [Victor Wong](https://x.com/vic4wong), [Kieren James-Lubin](https://x.com/kjameslubin) and [Jim Hormuzdiar](https://x.com/JamshidHormuz), the co-Founders of [BlockApps](https://blockapps.net) in 2023, with Bob joining in from episode 3 onwards.

As of January 2025, Bob is also working for BlockApps and we plan to continue the video series with further guest appearances and different topic areas:
