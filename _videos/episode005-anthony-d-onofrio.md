## Transcript

**Bob:** Right, well, let's get going, eh?

**Bob:** So, hi, [Texture]({{ '/people/anthony-d-onofrio/' | relative_url }})!  How are you?  It's been a while.

**Texture:** It's been a long time.  Always good to hear from you.

**Bob:** When I think of you, the first thing I think of is love.

**Texture:** Aw.

**Bob:** And something I'd spotted, going through making my notes, is that your Medium is called "Peace, Love, Revolution".

**Texture:** Yes.

**Bob:** So what's the story there?

**Texture:** So, you know, I was kinda, I wouldn't say a hippy.  I didn't dress like a hippy or hang out with hippies.   I took some psychedelics as a kid and had some experiences and kinda drove my passion for, you know, doing good things and supporting love in the world.
