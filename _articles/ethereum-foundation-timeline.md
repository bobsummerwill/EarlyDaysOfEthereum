[Tweet by Gav](https://twitter.com/gavofyork/status/895536200626425856): "Thanks to @VitalikButerin for the same – I could never have built #ethereum without you :)"

[Tweet by Peter](https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi/status/895560354951872512): "Ah yes, thank you @gavofyork for single handedly building #Ethereum! We – the other 30+ programmers – really enjoyed watching you work!"
