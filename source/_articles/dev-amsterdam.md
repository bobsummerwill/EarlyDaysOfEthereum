ÐΞV Amsterdam was one of the development hubs of [Ethereum ÐΞV](/articles/eth-dev-cic/), the development entity building Ethereum. Led by [Jeff Wilcke](/people/jeff-wilcke/), the Amsterdam team was responsible for [go-ethereum (Geth)](/articles/geth/) and the Mist browser.

## Formation

[Jeff Wilcke](/people/jeff-wilcke/) described the setup in his [Ethereum ÐΞV Update I](/articles/jeffs-ethereum-dev-update-i/) from November 2014:

> "Over the past months I've been been looking for a suitable office space to host the Amsterdam Hub... The lawyers have finally, after 2 months, gotten around to set up the company here in Amsterdam."

The Amsterdam hub operated separately from the [Berlin hub](/articles/eth-dev-berlin/), which focused on C++ development under [Gavin Wood](/people/gavin-wood/).

## Team

Per Jeff's November 2014 update, the team members joined in this order:

1. **[Alex van de Sande](/people/alex-van-de-sande/)** (avsa) - "The first that joined the Ams team." UX engineer working on the Mist browser prototype.

2. **[Viktor Trón](/people/viktor-tron/)** - "The second that joined the team." Working on devp2p networking. Jeff noted: "I've known Vik all the way back since the start of the project somewhere in Jan/Feb, he's a great guy and a real asset to this team."

3. **[Felix Lange](/people/felix-lange/)** - "The third that joined the team." Go developer working on Whisper implementation. Jeff called him "a super star gopher" who "has the ability to become a true Ethereum Core Dev."

4. **[Daniel Nagy](/people/daniel-nagy/)** - "The fourth that joined the team." Working on DHT specification and implementation for [Swarm](/articles/swarm/).

5. **[Maran Hidskes](/people/maran-hidskes/)** - "Last but certainly not least." Returning to the team in an administrative role after taking time off for family. Tasked with finding office space and handling ÐΞV Amsterdam administration.

Jeff also thanked [Nick Savers](/people/nick-savers/), [Caktux](/people/vincent-g/), and [Joris Bontje](/people/joris-bontje/) for their work on build systems, though they weren't formally on the team.

## Focus Areas

The Amsterdam team worked on:

- **[Geth](/articles/geth/)** - The Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol
- **Mist** - The flagship Web3 browser (later renamed Ethereum Wallet)
- **[ethereum.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js)** - Cross-implementation JavaScript framework
- **[devp2p](/articles/devp2p/)** - Peer-to-peer networking protocol
- **[Whisper](/articles/whisper/)** - Messaging protocol implementation
- **[Swarm](/articles/swarm/)** - Decentralized storage (specification and early development)

## Relationship to Other Hubs

ÐΞV had multiple development hubs:

- **Amsterdam** (Jeff Wilcke) - Go client, Mist browser
- **[Berlin](/articles/eth-dev-berlin/)** (Gavin Wood) - C++ client, Solidity, Mix IDE
- **Warsaw** (IMAPP) - JIT-compiled LLVM EVM implementation

The teams collaborated on shared specifications and testing, with [Christoph Jentzsch](/people/christoph-jentzsch/) in Berlin developing the comprehensive test suite used across all implementations.
