David Johnston is an early Bitcoin and blockchain entrepreneur who co-founded the BitAngels Network in May 2013, one of the first angel investor groups focused on cryptocurrency and blockchain startups. He is credited with coining the term "Decentralized Applications" (Dapps) in 2013.

Johnston co-founded the Dapp Fund in early 2014 and later established Yeoman's Capital, his family office, in 2016. He went on to lead strategy at DLTx, a publicly traded company, in 2021.

In the early Ethereum ecosystem, Johnston was an active participant in the broader Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community during the period when Ethereum was being conceived and launched. He had prior experience founding multiple technology startups, including a multi-million dollar renewable energy project at age 19.
