Gustav Simonssen was a Go developer who built a key manager implementation in [go-ethereum (Geth)](/articles/geth/). He was one of many developers drawn to the Berlin ETHDEV office, which functioned as an informal Ethereum hub in 2015.

Fabian Vogelsteller recalled Gustav as one of the people who "just showed up" at the Berlin office and became friends with the team:
