## Transcript

All righty, well thanks everyone for coming back. We've done a couple of videos, so we've done two on the early days of Ethereum and I actually did another video on Identity following that which you can check out on my channel. And in the process we're excited to reconnect with Bob Somerwell.

So Bob will ask to introduce himself in a second but he actually went quite in depth you know in reaction to the videos and helping to work together to patch up the whole story from our collective memory on the early days of Ethereum. Wrote a long blog post that you should check out and we'll link in the notes and we asked him to join us here today to kind of dig more into the story and also just generally catch up. So with that maybe I'll hand it to Bob to do a quick intro and we can just kind of get into it.

[[0:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=57s) **Bob:**
So yeah, hi, thanks so much for the invite. Like I said to you guys, I love those first two videos, I love this history and it was great to both hear that and have a slightly different perspective as well. Our paths have overlapped in some ways and haven't in others, so there are a few things that came up which I wasn't myself aware of.

I mean just for everyone's background about me and who I am. So I got interested in blockchain in 2014 but it was 2015 where I really like kind of jumped in and that happened because I was working in I had a six-month contract and was working in Toronto around the same time that Ethereum was doing a mainland launch and I'd actually met Vitalik for the first time in 2014 but just kind of following along a little bit, not actually doing anything but then moving to Toronto it's just like orders of magnitude more stuff going on and meetups and Anthony Fiorio's Bitcoin Decentral co-working space and everything. So I got like really very addicted through that year and it was like right, I can't not get involved, right?

It's like it's like you're there at the birth of the web or whatever and you've met Tim Berners-Lee and he's about to like go live on the web and it's like how can you not want to get involved? So I just started sort of volunteering and helping. My background prior to that was in the games industry so like 15 years of C++.

So I was like well you know I can do something with CPP Ethereum and I was really into mobile and wearables so my first thing I set myself is you know can I get Ethereum running on my smartwatch? You know could you get smartwatch and go around it like bing there's some money you know that'd be really cool. So yeah I just started doing stuff on there that was about the time that Gav was part in company with the foundation as well so there was kind of a dearth of people on that team so you know like that period I ended up being like I think the only person in the world who was actually helping on that like you know no companies, nobody was helping and then I ended up getting hired into the foundation in early 2016 and yeah I've been involved on Ethereum Enterprise, Ethereum Hyperledger and more recently Ethereum Plastic for nearly a decade now.

[[3:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=237s) **Victor:**
Yeah Bob and well and to be open to everyone like we're old friends and we're happy to have you as our first guest host on this thing but also you are like you know the Nelson Mandela of the Ethereum ecosystem. You're friends with everyone you know you've been in everywhere so it's great to have your perspective on things.

[[4:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=263s) **Bob:**
Thank you.

[[4:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=265s) **Victor:**
So I and for as Karen has mentioned for anyone who hasn't seen Bob's blog post it's notionally a blog post almost a full novel probably a novella size it has pictures of a lot of the people we're talking about. You dug up so much content out of there.

[[4:43]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=283s) **Bob:**
Were those your personal pictures or it's just yeah yeah just stuff I had. I mean another thing here is there's a couple of articles on my own blog from earlier that I linked into there as well which was there's one called Ethereum Foundation People and one called Ethereum Foundation Timeline. So I made those in late 2017 early 2018 because there was no canonical history of any of this.

[[5:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=317s) **Victor:**
Yeah.

[[5:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=317s) **Bob:**
Like how did Ethereum start I mean it's in people's heads it's all secondhand stories that you hear from people that were around but you know it's like what's true what isn't because I think especially on that like foundation side it was such a mess right just like all different people weren't getting on blowing up kind of like the parity versus the foundation and Charles you know and like God what you know so it I think some people had almost taken this um position of like we don't talk about that right right because anything I say like it's gonna offend somebody else so just la la la it doesn't matter that you know um but uh but yeah so I started gathering that list of well you know who were the people that were around in the pre-foundation days and in that and um so yeah I've got this got this one page this people page which I think is really cool just it's got so that's basically from 2013 through to early 2018 identifying anyone that I could that was involved with Ethereum pre-foundation or who worked for the foundation in those early years and one of the things that's really great there is DEVCON zero which happened in I think October 2014 so that was the very first DEVCON but it was a closed event that wasn't a public event yeah and it was it was foundation people at that time but there were also you know some other key community sort of people there as well and they did this one thing at the start that was introductions so there's this video that's about 15 or 20 minutes long of everybody like hi I'm glad I'm here doing you know proof of stake research just see these these you know so young so many people that you know like really early 20s yeah you know and turning up and it's like that's you know that's so and so right and some of these people as well you know they're not involved anymore you know they're sort of like footnotes in history but but but you have that record and so yeah that that that list of people I got I got all of that together and the reason that that came about was in late 2017 I got a message from Laura Shin saying hey I hear Ming's been sacked at the foundation like do you know anything about this right and I said well no I don't but it wouldn't surprise me but you know basically it'd be like Vitalik or maybe Hudson could tell you but I nobody nobody else could tell you anyway and you know it sort of came out well yeah she's you know she's not being sacked but she's agreed to leave right and then it's like well what's what's next so I contacted Vitalik and said you know hey is anything I can do to help you know what can I do you know and he said well the one thing you can do is can you like try and talk to people and work out like you know what would good look like right what do people think a good ethereum foundation would look like and so that started my sort of adventure really of like right I'm going to go and talk to all the founders all the other people and try and work out like you know what what and then that just turned into really a mind you know a experiment on my side of like okay so you know to my mind being was terrible so how did she get hired like what was going on you know whatever two and a half years back but that looked like a good option you know like what how did it work before you know like what how did the foundation come about and like what what were the group of leaders and like what were all the dynamics between all of these people so uh yeah I went down quite a rabbit hole there and that's that was the the sort of the genesis for that information gathering um and I learned a lot uh and that information as well I gave to Laura and to the other two authors that were doing their ethereum books is kind of like right there is no canonical but this is kind of what I found which is maybe like the best

[[9:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=585s) **Victor:**
information that there was at that time yeah well and also it's to your point it's that I think generally people have sort of survivorship bias about you know like everything works smooth but innovation is messy you know it's messy and it's like you know there are million and one different paths that things could have went to and we just want to acknowledge all that like you know like given where the ecosystem is today and even though you know it's amazing to me that so many people know about it that later I spent we all spent the first years trying to get anyone to listen to us talk about blockchain and no one you know everyone just glazed over right so it's it's just kind of nice to take that retrospective view at this point oh went a little bit far

[[10:33]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=633s) **Bob:**
okay we'll just go with it yeah one of the things that I I know that Vitalik said again it was maybe in Laura Shin's book was like the the founding of ethereum was very atypical um because it was essentially like here's here's a white paper out to a bunch of random people uh who may be interested and it's like basically like first people that turn up right you're the founders like you know a number of them they'd you know they'd not even met each other before you know not really a lot of knowledge um and so yeah like there were lots of um interpersonal things that just didn't work at all it's just like you know like founding a company and I'm sure you guys you know have this experience yourself right you want to start with people that you kind of know and trust a bit because you know that you're going through the fire together so you know you better have some stickability with you and um you know common alignment or at least knowing that you've got good communication to go through those bad times right you know you know that you can work it out and what seemed to happen on the theorem was absolutely the polar opposite of that it's just random bunch of people who were there didn't really know each other like make that commitment before you even know what you're doing you're doing right yeah and so

[[12:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=732s) **Kieren:**
that didn't work so great and I think let me actually I wanted to ask about that I'm also just looking at the list of the ethereum foundation people which is remarkably long for the type of initiative it was you know we talk about this because we're a management team and we're trying to get people to focus on particular goals and things our company wants to do and such do you think there was any benefits to this level of you could call it disorganization or just you know um I kind of think if there were what you know a benefit and it wasn't merely just an inefficient and painful process that ethereum succeeded in spite of it's kind of it embodied the ethos and it it let people like it's how it put the idea out there and then people fought for its destiny like ethereum existed and then they wanted to be part of taking it to and he saw the clients and all that too sorry jim go ahead I was gonna say it kind of worked like a

[[13:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=790s) **Jim:**
blockchain works in fact yeah lots of random people coming together with some underlying principle to

[[13:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=796s) **Victor:**
organize things and then they fight it out but what's that law that organization technology reflects the organization yeah something like that like yes sorry yeah I mean I I I guess

[[13:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=812s) **Bob:**
in general yes you know having that like frothing emergent like stuff is is good I think where it was really screwed though was to do with money and and you know the ICO funding right that it's basically like okay here we're doing the thing and here the money is all actually in this organizational group and the people in that group are being funded you know are in this privileged position um it's something which um brian bellendorf said to me in later years was it's sort like the original sin of ethereum is if you want to have that kind of collaboration so you know whatever stuff like the ea and hyperledger or even just you know the rather looser protocol development around ethereum you don't want to pay one team and not the others because that just screws that battlefield so um you have this situation for example where um you know you've got the c++ client and you've got geth um you know you did have a python client as well so you had that good triangulation but it was essentially like the the funded ones were c++ and go and then they have the the money crisis of of like oh my god is this thing even going to happen right we've got cut scope c++ is gone gab ends up going out of the way and then you have parity you know having one of the major clients but without funding so it's like geth oh geth that's the you know that's the favored child right you know that's the it's not like the official client but it is the official client so all that sort of like separation of implementation versus specification and you know in that free market around that was really skewed because the money was with geth and geth were in the foundation and they've got you know metallics kind of blessing and everything so i think that's where things were great because you did have the diversity but it wasn't fair diversity and i think if you look at what's happening now on the consensus clients for i was going to say ethereum 2 it's not called ethereum 2 anymore but you know the separation that you have with those execution clients and consensus clients none of those consensus clients are made by the foundation the foundation doesn't have client teams they do funding like they got the grants and i think all of those teams are going to be grant recipients so that's kind of centralization in a way but it isn't even playing field in terms of the development right because you've got an evenness of funding and that wasn't the case you know originally for ethereum and i think that that made a lot of bitterness as well because it's like well why do you guys got the money like we're making another one as well and or you know other parts uh of the ecosystem like there wasn't a grants program for a number of years yeah between about 2015 and 2018 there wasn't even a grants program you know you've got the foundation sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars and teams couldn't even get funded for doing anything so uh so yeah i think the diversity is good but the money was bad interesting yeah i

[[17:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1024s) **Kieren:**
think right okay that's a it's a good strong point so if you compare it to like a bitcoin which i know less about the history of the development of bitcoin but it was kind of similar there was less of a there was no pre-mine and no token pre-sale and so the people who were in it were in it for general interest and it was really sincerely uh an even playing field and i would argue you know and in some ways ethereum has made bigger strides than bitcoin especially since you know let's say 2015 some of the value prop of bitcoin is that it never changes and that's kind of part of why it holds its value in some way and but it's i think you know been stifled a little bit um for that reason i think it's pretty hard probably to make step function positive changes in a fully decentralized manner another major difference

[[18:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1088s) **Bob:**
they're talking about clients is um it was a very deliberate decision right on ethereum to to separate the specification from the clients and that there were multiple clients from day one i see if i can find my twitter thread i was finding these the other day i was finding the first commits for for pi ethereum pi app um or pi ethereum as it was cpp ethereum and go ethereum and they were all um i think they were all november or december i think they were all 2013 not even 2014 for those three yeah um and then ethereum j looked like it started in about

[[18:49]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1129s) **Victor:**
april i think but you know yeah jim karen you guys started a theorem h in 2014 yeah we were

[[18:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1137s) **Kieren:**
much later we were um when did we get a quarter 2014 yeah that's that's appropriate and i had worked on ethereum just in the summer so starting kind of maybe june 2014 i got to know the project pretty well and then i had gone back to berkeley i was in new york for the summer and met jim september october something like that and we started work more or less right away more jim than me but um so yeah so there was a big time delay on on our side and yeah i think okay yeah bob it's an interesting point right i think probably they could have um there was some some real mismanagement at different times both with the running out of funds not doing any hedging and then later i i guess i agree that it could have just been more fair and open feeling and would have alienated fewer people and it could have even just been bigger than it is today obviously we're talking about a smashing success here but it's sort of the idea and the community was so powerful that it you know this definitely uh succeeded in spite of aspect i think there was value still in this like throw it out there get people to fight over it but it it probably overcorrected and lots of these people also just went and started their own thing

[[20:26]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1226s) **Bob:**
i mean the other thing is right at the start there it's like well the people that doing it that was the whole world right you know that was everything right was uh several months i mean all of that early work on the clients actually was before the foundation even existed that was actually unfunded yeah um because i'm looking at the dates so the the white paper came out in november 2013 sorry 2013 pytherium was started on november the 19th 2013 uh gav actually was in contact with vitalik on that same day cpp ethereum started four days later 23rd of uh of december obviously some uh over christmas uh hacking on these things going on um and then go ethereum uh was december the 26th so just three further days um the foundation got formed i think in may april or may 2014 but the crown sale didn't conclude until september 2014 so you'd actually got about nine months worth of development on all of these three clients that was actually unfunded so you know you know i think i think that unfairness kind of came in a little bit later i think for that phase it was like nobody got funded oh sorry um you know nobody got funded though there was the retrospective payback right you know when when the crown sale had gone through you had you know money for early contributors which i think i think that was nearly 10 percent yeah for like 100 120 people like some people made out like absolute bandits for for those early months um but then yeah following that uh there was hiring of actual you know staff onto those teams um and that i think is when it became kind of uneven because you already had ethereum j for a number of months there and that you know that that never got funded and then you uh and then you guys starting whenever you were starting so yeah it kind of became uneven i think at that point and and and the probably the worst of it of all was for parity you know when when that team spun out and you basically did have a major you know rapidly load-bearing client um and it was just you know unfunded especially in with gap who was you know have been the cto and wrote the yellow paper and had the first working client and you know all of the value he delivered and then it's like right sorry you're out and you're not getting any money

[[23:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1398s) **Kieren:**
you know yes do you um so my memory around the c++ client was that there were funds to do a security audit for two clients but one at a time and it was tight right like and so they did go ethereum first and i think they did actually do the security audit on cpp ethereum but i'm not

[[23:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1425s) **Bob:**
quite sure did you know you know maybe maybe there'd been an intention to do that but then the money right ran out before it happened um i mean my understanding in terms of uptake as well is cpp ethereum was like working first but then go ethereum just like caught up and overtook it like really fast uh so when they were making those decisions on cutting funding which would have been mid-2015 it's like hey gabby you're the cto but it's your code base that's got to cop it

[[24:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1465s) **Jim:**
and then that's what happened and i mean i was i was sort of building uh the various clients quite a bit because i was trying to integrate with them at the time and my memory was that the c++ client had all the newest stuff in it first so if i wanted to see something first i would go there but the go client was more stable like because i think because they were putting so much stuff into the c++ client it was often in an unstable situation and so i would typically kind of go to c++ first to see the new stuff but if it wasn't building that day i would run over to

[[24:59]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1499s) **Bob:**
and try it out yeah i mean and that would make complete sense because the other thing to know with the c++ client is that was that was where the test suites were done you know like all the all the tests were generated out of that code base so as you say all of the protocol changes whatever would happen there first then you do the test generation through that and then those are the tests for for uh for other clients so even when cpp ethereum as a client like died it didn't die within that testing suite for years it's like right even though nobody's actually like running this or using it on mainnet or anything you know we've got to keep we've got to keep maintaining that one because that's where the tests are coming from um so yeah that that front line was really like leading across sol-c the tests and cpp ethereum you know all of those actually were bundled together into a single workspace as well with all of the gooey apps like with mix and aleph zero aleph one five it took 24 hours to build the bloody thing um but uh that would be because it was all around gab right you know gab was leading all of that you know he was he was building that client he was writing the yellow paper he was you know working there with uh with with christian and uh and christoph um on that specification and testing stuff like that you know all of that was was there and then on guess on uh jeff's side you know but you know just just doing get right it wasn't wasn't a broader thing and and that that gets team were working closer with mist you know with aster on mist like for a for a good while i don't think cpp ethereum even worked with mist you know it's like all these groups not really talking to each other um but but yeah that would make sense like a lot of it was was gav led and and wait

[[27:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1630s) **Victor:**
sol-c the solidity compiler that was part of that c++ group too yeah that makes sense because

[[27:17]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1637s) **Bob:**
it's written in c++ but yeah it was all under web3 umbrella okay i remember web3 umbrella yes so yeah web3 umbrella was a uh a git repo with sub repos for um you know for for f it was called f it's just called f the executable so you've had f and again um but yeah you had f you had sol-c um you had uh mix which was the original ide yeah um uh cute um uh client you had aleph zero which was the gooey minor um yeah so it's like right here here's a good press the mine button you know um and then you had aleph one which was sort of i guess it was like kind of like a gooey client runner thing i can't remember the exact scope but but it was sort of like right you're running a node but you've kind of got a gooey on it and i can't remember what it had but you know whatever logs going by and i guess you could like fiddle with settings or whatever um but yeah all that was in web3 umbrella um that's a lot that was a lot yeah and all of the dependents they were all really test and the tests as well right right but then they were all really codependent i mean when i started one of the first things i did was like what are the dependencies on all these things like what is all of this stuff because you have like libraries with it as well it's like lib

[[28:57]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1737s) **Kieren:**
lib web web3 base yeah dev p2p live p2p they were sitting documentation all over the place

[[29:09]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1749s) **Bob:**
i mean you know i think you know i think what had happened there that gab was sort of trying to do but it never came to fruition and then he left was it's like right let's try and make this modular right we're going to try and do a modular thing and pull apart the networking and the database and this out and the other but it was it was pulled apart into separate repos before there were actually stable interfaces between any of these so you had to use the latest stuff of anything anyway like you couldn't mix and match because there was no versioning there was no interplace discipline on any of it um you had to use all the latest ones together but then it was all split into these separate repos so it's like right you're making a change on one of them and then whatever updating the submodules and like like that wasn't atomic it was it was just a big old mess um so yeah one of the first things i did was like you know work out infer infer a dependency diagram map a path to pulling it all back into a into a monolithic workspace um doing like automated builds that we somehow didn't have um and specifically decoupling solsi and the tests from the client right right um so for solsi for example because it was tied in with this full workspace it was literally a 24-hour build it was like compiling chromium from source twice compiling qt all of this stuff so just to get you know and there weren't binaries available for solsi either like you had to build all of this stuff yourself to be able to like compile you know a smart contract to do anything you have to do all of that so i remember you know after all that decomposition i you know i got it so you could just do solsi and you know that was a quick build and then i did like homebrew and it's like so you could do like brew install solsi and it did it in like five seconds and everyone's like oh my god this is amazing um but yeah it was uh yeah it was a bit of a mess i i do remember waiting like

[[31:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1894s) **Victor:**
you know many times trying to build things coming back looking at it saying like this can't be like my machine's got to be broken because like it can't be this long can't be like eight hours like nothing i could imagine would take more than eight hours to do enough but you're right

[[31:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1910s) **Bob:**
just like you know talking about that you know creative brew of lots of different people and uncoordinated and everything one of my first observations on joining the the foundation is these people seem allergic to professionalism because that seemed as you know in an organized way well you're one of the baddies you know you're the status quo you're trying to subvert it and take it over you know things as simple as like like you know have we got like technical leads that actually lead you know have we got any project management have we got any it have we got anything and it's like no it's just like a jumble of people doing stuff um and it's like oh how on earth can you develop software in such a chaotic environment um but that was kind of the vibe as well that was seen as a good thing um you know because it's because that's a defensive cultural thing right you know we don't we don't want this to be a silicon valley thing yeah you know i i think um

[[32:58]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=1978s) **Kieren:**
i just have a comment it's interesting and maybe i commented on this in one of the other videos one of these rare big software projects that did not very much come from the united states it's canada it's different parts of europe you know and one of those confusing things about to your point about who got paid for the clients on the foundation i think like i remember there being a with zug the the you know the canton basically around it they were like there's tax stuff and all that sort of thing but they also sort of intended to hire and operate locally people would either move there or they'd hire eth zurich grads or whatever um i don't know the details specifically but i think that didn't quite end up happening that way in sort of as a surprise and i saw some of this firsthand at the meeting in which um you know amir and charles were you know sent on their way um the the client team set up in their own countries and that was like a bit of a script flip like gavin wanted to be in berlin because the i guess the devs were good and expensive and be like living there you know um inexpensive excuse me um and yeah i think it's just you know you would running my own business you would never make such a decision in such a flip manner where like overnight we're like oh we're doing a different country you know but they that was kind of a regular occurrence to some extent major things changing um you know as part of how the foundation plus sort of operated that that i saw and again it didn't seem to hurt you know quite as much as you might expect um but yeah but i think you know you you had to have you were lucky in how people works how excited people were about the project that survived all of this um and again from our side you know we're sitting in the bay area at that time and we're like why do they keep doing all of these things like they're trying to build a thousand things

[[35:06]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=2106s) **Bob:**
and it's hard to build one thing um yeah i mean so there were separate legal entities for those as well right so you have dev ag in in in berlin and then you know there was then there was an amsterdam thing uh for for the guest team you had the london stuff as well which was mainly communications sort of stuff um you know with with stefan and george hallam uh ian meikle and one other person who i forget um but you know you sort of talk about you know these people working for the ethereum foundation like but it's it was always woolier than that so yeah you did have the this the stipum in in zoog um but most people even if they're working full-time they weren't actually working for that you know so when i had my contract it was with the the for-profit at dev in berlin that was who i was actually working for and then they were funded by the foundation and an f dev in general that was another big split that was right was the you got the foundation but then you had f dev that was like the kind of umbrella group for that that gav was leading essentially so i think the the amsterdam thing like rolled into berlin i think that was all sort of f dev side um and that in itself was you know a huge item of conflict i know um again in laura's book i think joe was talking about that right was was the gav kind of like wanted a big chunk of money it's like right you know the funds are there from the crown sale now so you know give them all to us right and it's like yeah i don't know that we want to give you all the funds like you know as you go but uh that you know that was typical of that period is just a mess of complexity and interpersonal things and organizational complexity and with that with that um the swiss people thing so my understanding on that was that was like a uh a main motivation for like getting renting that spaceship building right was the intention was that there were going to be a load of people there but like maybe it was i think tests testing was one of the ones i heard was maybe a goal there is like right we're going to get a load of swiss people to test things and there's also like me high with his full-on ideas holon of working spacey things around the world

[[37:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=2272s) **Victor:**
and when and also to make it a little bit more earlier like you know same time like very shortly consensus emerged out of that too and they were doing a bunch of work you know we were working you know we were technically working under consensus for you know the first low parts of it too and all of that was like in the mix you know like everywhere so i want to jump ahead a bit because we have you as an etc expert and in our last one we had a lot of questions around um what we remembered from slocket and the dow hack um so maybe you could walk us through that and you know how etc emerged out of that that part was a little bit vague to us um because we didn't we didn't follow much on you know how those pieces all came together yeah so i mean um

[[38:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=2325s) **Bob:**
one of the groups or companies that came out of this kind of like shrinking of the foundation was that on that c++ team that got most of the cuts a good chunk of those people went to just went straight to parity and just like carried on with that new client but christoph james who had been working leading that testing effort who were just talking about those same tests he and uh and stephan toile who had been community communication communications leader you know that sort of community stuff um and lefteris who'd also been on c++ team those three went off and formed a company called slocket so slocket being smart locks uh just the idea that you you know whatever if you're doing an airbnb or something that you can you know that you could have a smart lock and that you could go and do your contract with someone for the rental and then that could be you know enabling something on the lot that's checking a an oracle or an on-chain thing and and so on um and so that that was the their their product area at devcon one they did like an on-stage demo that was like a pot of it was like a pebble like a pot yeah i remember that like doing this transaction that turned it on to make a cup of tea yeah that was the the on-stage demo um but what seemed to happen there was like they didn't want to do an ico um they wanted it to be fairer i guess because around that era the more later you know you you saw lots of cash grab icos and it's like right here's all the money up front you know we're not going to live it what are you going to do right so so they didn't want to do that you know because they were very genuine people come out of the foundation and were you know kind of you know ideologically driven so um vitalik had written stuff about dowels right you know i think they were mentioned in the white paper even um and it's like well maybe we can make a dowel so and i think that was just slocket dowel really originally and it was like right we're gonna have a dowel the money's gonna go into there but then it's only going to get released to us as we deliver milestones so it's kind of like this separation of like right the dowel is where the money is and that's controlled by the token holders slocket as a company is a service provider into that but we're a sackable service provider and we're only going to get paid as we go through the milestones so it's like oh yeah that's really interesting yeah um and i to my understanding that's what was presented at devcon1 okay i remember was like hey we're slocket this is what we're doing and we're going to do a dowel with it and it's like oh cool but then they kept working on that that dowel stuff after devcon1 and it just seemed to like warp into what we've made like a dowel framework it's a dowel library you know because we want other people to be able to do this as well but then that sort of turned into well actually how about it isn't just us how about it could be anything like anyone could have a service provider you could propose anything into it and then it became the dowel okay um and it wasn't capped there was no cap on the contributions into it um there was really nothing else that you could do on ethereum at that point it was kind of like the first application really well i mean you did have a two a few you have digix this this gold thing you did have um die i think was sort of coming to life just about at that point but the dowel was kind of like the first big thing right and it just sort of snowballed and snowballed right because it's like um there was it was also touted as zero risk because you could exit with your funds right if you didn't like the result of what was happening you could just exit and have your f back so it's kind of like this is risk-free right it's like a risk you know it's like a sovereign bond or whatever right there's no downside here this is risk-free so tons of people are like well what else am i gonna do i'm just sitting here on my ether i can't do anything well you know pile on in and the ethereum crowd sale raised what is 16 million i think in bitcoin which was i think it was number five crowd sale of all time you know it's like comparing to kickstarter projects right so it's like you know maybe they'll do you know two or three million maybe five and it just went up until it was you know it was just absolutely gigantic um and i remember at the time thinking you know this is i don't like this like the dow it's not this is not a good idea yeah and and the main reason i was thinking of that was is this a security right is this seen as you know money transfer stuff um because you've got slock at the company and then they had this thing called dow link that was sort of a service company for paying people in real life it was that was some eth swiss thing i think or what's the bitcoin swiss um and then you had the dow itself you had the curators as well so anyone could propose you know a smart contract that encoded their proposal right they would make a written description of the thing and here's a smart contract doing it um and the curator's role was like to verify yeah what they've sort of said in text is kind of what they've done it was meant to be like you know this kind of administrative role but what happened is all of those guys that was their name their names and faces up on the website you know so like dow hub website is just like a who's who of the ethereum foundation basically and it didn't say you know christian reich weissner creator of solidity it said christian right weissner ethereum foundation metallic ethereum foundation you know so lots of people were like this is an ethereum foundation project right because you you've all got your names on everything so i thought there was firstly there was huge like legal liability on those guys because where slocket have got these layers of legal protection these guys haven't they're just doing it as individuals um and i remember fabian um talking to me and talking to the group in the foundation it's like you know i've been talking to some of my friends and they're like you know they don't think this is a great idea and i'm thinking of talking to a lawyer and and gav backed out right uh a couple of weeks before all the disaster gav just backed out he's like you know this is you know this this is not what i signed up for i thought it was just a small role and now it's like presented as a lot more and you know uh so he he backed out a lot of the others didn't because because it was like well if we back out it's going to like ruin it and it's like a great experiment um but i thought there was huge liability to them i thought there were legal risks um and i also just thought it was a stupid idea like why would you have thousands of random people putting their money in a bucket and then let's like vote on what to do with it right who are these people like what do they even know like about a business proposal or uh anything it's just like this is a stupid idea but you know i didn't have my eye on the fact that all of the tech stack was incredibly immature at that point right yeah there's no best practices there's no libraries it's just here's some code and and they just went all in right it was like code is law yeah you know the smart contract is the contract you know yolo you can't stop us

[[47:32]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=2852s) **Victor:**
but but okay and then the hack happens right and and i remember the details of the hack being they found a flaw in the smart contract code and they could basically withdraw those funds into another account and i remember there was some kind of race between like the people at um the dow slash locket who are like using the same exploit to like drain the account like using the same hack basically is that right yeah so there was this re-entrancy vote

[[48:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=2890s) **Bob:**
um where it it's really sort of wanted to do with atomic operations or order of operations so your re-entrancy was that you could be calling uh because people were supplying like their proposals and it's like hey here's a smart contract that's implementing mine you were like calling into their code but you can't know what theirs is going to do so there was this re-entrancy issue where within that other person supplied code you could like kind of call back in and it was sort of like so it was to do with child dows so this whole zero risk thing was like if you didn't like proposals that were happening you could make a child dow of saying well hey i'm i'm out right i'm taking my ether and my voting off into this other one right i'm not i'm not following you i'm going there and other people could join you as well so i guess the idea was like right you know here we've got this totally over general dow but we're going to make a you know like a defi dow or an nft dow or a whatever right and and it's like i guess a little bit like some of the thoughts for for consensus and hub and spoke is like you know you're going to get this universe of stuff just flourishing out and childs and and so on but yeah the problem on that child dow thing is that there was this re-entrancy bug where rather than just being able to pull your f or your share you can actually go in and pull more and more so you have this using this kind of child dow and pulling a giant amount of uh of of the funds into that child dow and then within 30 days they'd be able to exit with the funds but but kind of the um the the blessings i guess of that setup is they're not immediately exiting with the funds right they haven't gone already and sold it on an exchange and they're done before you notice you have got this period uh and then the other thing is that you could join them you can go into the child now as well so after the hack you know there was this appeal out hey you know did did anyone participate in this you know specific child there was anyone in there it's like yeah you know yeah somebody else is in there and then what you could do is you could you know you could child down again it's like you could do with another one it's like right well i'm gonna grab it off you and you're gonna grab it off me and um so you know you could have had this this dow wars thing of like you can never stop it but you could delay it indefinitely so that was one of them but then the other white hat thing is like okay well we know about the bug so we can do it too you can have white hat people like well we're going to see a lot of the money out of the top out of the top now as well but we're doing it for good right we're doing it here to keep it to give it back right so so yeah you had all of those games going on within that existing setup but then as a reaction to that you had all of this discussion about well you know are we going to react are we not going to react first the first proposal was a was a soft fork um but you know it was just going to like blacklist out stuff to do with the with the hacker right and they did do that soft

[[51:36]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=3096s) **Victor:**
fork right i remember they did that soft fork first and i think it might even have gone on

[[51:42]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=3102s) **Bob:**
test nets and things but it never went live okay uh because it was spotted that it was a denial of service attack uh because that blacklisting was like you know not accounted for in the crypto economics so it was like yeah yeah you you had a denial of service attack um thing on that soft fork so it got done and then it got undone and then the hard fork was like okay well we can we can go in and we can do an irregular state transaction uh where at a certain block you know you're just going to have a hard-coded thing which sticks different uh byte code into uh into the address of the of the dow which is like okay yeah that thing it didn't happen but you know what's actually at that address is a simple refund thing where you can all get your money back um so so that's that was the down hard fork okay i just want to ask where were you

[[52:54]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=3174s) **Kieren:**
at this time because i know you got involved um i believe later with etc because it didn't exist yet um and so you know how in terms of your personal perspective on all this we're actually implementing it anything um yourself because obviously you've got pretty deep knowledge of

[[53:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=3193s) **Bob:**
the technical uh internals um yes i was working for the foundation i was on the c++ team at that point i you know this is about three or four months after i i'd started um the thing that was really interesting to me was um how different people's thoughts or perspectives were even within the foundation you know that you'd have people say working on gaff going well of course we shouldn't do anything well of course we should and it's like you know i've been working with you for a year like what what you think that like you know you had this real mixture of uh of reactions um and i mean my my first reaction was well you know of course you don't do anything like it's an immutable blockchain that's the whole point like you know you don't like the outcome well you know tough titties you know you saw you've seen so many uh you know like man gox you know man gox you didn't have the bitcoin is going all that you know let's let's you know let's try and fix this up or um you know i and i think the only reason it happened was because of the scale of it you know that it was a significant chunk of the entire eth money money base um and also i think that you know things weren't super great on funding and you know it wasn't like ethereum was sure to succeed it was quite you know nascent at that point yeah and i know that there were also worries about the proof of stake transition and the fact that if you had a large amount of uh of the ether in you know hostile hands that you could maybe have years of like griefing attacks and stuff like that um but also i think there was just you know a lot of people were like well you know this is theft right you know that money was intended for building the ecosystem and you know some guys come in and stolen it and if we can fix that well we should so so yeah i mean i you know my immediate reaction was you shouldn't but i i also it was like well you know whatever that seems to be the consensus that we do it you know and okay off off you know off we go um no i wasn't at the foundation many more months after that anyway but uh you know there was this real schism though i think from what i saw i think probably about 85 of people wanted to do the hard fork and 15 didn't or maybe 80 20 but i think i think there was pretty strong consensus to to to do it but that was you know very contentious for you know a not tiny group of people you know that a lot of people that had got involved with ethereum have done so because they they kind of wanted smart uh you know bitcoin with smart contracts and and if you're of that bitcoiny mindset then yeah like of course you don't you know don't screw with things but but i think there's also this larger group that were like well ether isn't money anyway like that was a messaging that had been given out at the time it's like no no it's fuel right it's fuel for the engine though i think part of that is just like trying to dodge legal liability but but you know that was also true as well you know this whole world computer you know here's a platform right you know it's a platform like the web or android so i think it was sort of like that that was the mental split is like is it money and if it's money you don't move people's monies without private keys like you know that's that's a mortal sin and on the other side you're like well no it's a bug right it's a bug in the platform and it's like well but it's but it was a bug in the smart contract well you know if you've worked on serious software projects you know people hack shit on the wrong layers all the time right because it's going to give you a better user experience like you know you don't have to be you know pure on that it's really about how the thing works so you know you get hacks in the wrong layers all the time um and if if you're just seeing it as a software platform

[[57:55]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=3475s) **Victor:**
then yeah it's a bug you fix the bug so it's rare in life that you can actually see a counterfactual but in this case we can because etc was created at that time and kind of emerged out of that so like um you know can you talk a little bit about that and how is that gone because you're deep into that ecosystem obviously as the you know director of the ethereum classic cooperative like how does it work now like you know what how did those words divide um and then you know how are those words

[[58:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=3510s) **Bob:**
continuing so over that month or so right where it's like you know the money's been stolen into the sub down are we going to do anything you know you have the most um you know vigorous debate on all platforms right you know the the topic you know what's going to happen how's it going to go and everything right so you know i don't think there's anyone that was like unaware of this stuff happening you know it's very very everyone with their eyes open um but yeah you know you just you just have this group of people kind of gathering together and it's like no you know we're not going to go with it this is not going to happen or at least like you know we're not following that hard for maybe people do but you know a bunch of people deciding not to um the other thing i thought was really interesting at the time and was to my mind the the best thing of all about that chain split is to that point i don't think there's ever been a minority chain that survived right the the standard thinking is like you're going to have a winning side and a losing side and you know that it's going to happen and we'll see where where's the thing you know where are the people going which is the winner and then the losers you know well you know like people stop mining it will just die right because it's the loser chain so there's no economic value there and you know forget it but what actually happened on the etc side is you know you had miners that were like what you're just going to keep on mining i'm not updating or you know you know some of it going you know the evil ethereum foundation and you know vitalik's a dictator you know i mean i don't think any of that's true um but you have got people that were like no i'm going to keep going and then look block production's still going and you know it's still happening uh and then poloniex listed it and then it's got a market value and then you've got speculative activity around that you've got ether holders like dumping their etc you know it's hey it's free money um but also you've got other people on the other side going well you know i see a real value here and like this etc is going cheap so you know noticeably notably barry silver who was the first non-bit in ethereum to that point presumably like based on pre-mine and various other things but was like well oh actually like you know an immutability focused etc uh you know would be would be really interesting so yeah you just got this sort of grassroots thing forming you got volunteers jumping up saying hey you know i'm a developer i'll keep maintaining the the classic geth clients and so on and um you know it found its own uh legs there you know you had like the the ethereum subreddit was like a primary communication platform at that point and then you had like an ethereum classic one you know being created and some people in you know one side some on the other but you know it got quite bitter in the end right you know you've got a lot of people that were like you foundation you guys either just ruined you know you've just ruined the project and you had people um on the other side seeing is seeing etc is really illegitimate you know as saying well look you know it's just a money grab you just want your free money um you know why are these bitcoiners kind of coming over like they weren't interested in ethereum before and now they are like that's not you know uh you know that's that's not good and you did obviously have a bunch of speculators in there as well so that's all a bit nasty too um but i think the thing that like said that those communities um finally was this like 100 f meme which came about because somebody tweeted hey vitalik i hear that you're working on ethereum classic is there any truth to this and he said no um you know i'm only working on ethereum and the person then said well what if etc had more market cap than ethereum and he said no i still wouldn't work on it 100 f like he wasn't saying it in a purity pledge way he was just in the way he does being just making a factual statement but then i remembered you know joe replied you know i'm 100 f and then it's like everyone's doing it right it's this purity pledge you know everyone is expected to you know pledge allegiance to f so it became a you know oh shit is this an either or like you can't be in both like if you if you you're interested in etc then you you know you're a dirty person so i think that that really wedged it you know wedged it permanently apart at that point and also you know a number of the people that were um volunteering on etc you know they were really angry they were like you know why you know being involved for two two and a bit years in this project you know really pumped about everything that you can do with ethereum and that you guys have you know have wrecked it so there was a lot of you know bitterness from that etc side back um but then you know things kind of split apart and and over time etc you know found its own path so with the real differentiation being um well firstly that the dow hack didn't happen that was the only initial difference uh very rapidly though there was this conclusion um that fixed economic policy was needed you know that etc was really like bitcoin with ethereum technology but you know bitcoin uh you know culture and ethos so it's like right you know there's no fixed monetary policy for for ethereum i mean you see this over many years it's like you know change of change of block rewards ice age delays of the burning you know many many changes so um that was the first kind of like major change on the etc side was introduction of that fixed monetary policy because there was consensus that that was an import you know that was like bad inheritance that we that we want to fix and the other thing that that enabled was the uh the grayscale etc fund so at that point it's like right okay this is really a bitcoin feeling thing and you know there's a feeling that there's there's a value here so then from from that grayscale then created the uh etc cooperative that i work from you know so a share of the fees went into that kind of not quite a foundation but a bit like a foundation you know a non-profit to support the ecosystem uh and then the other thing more recently is is just proof of work you know there was there was sort of fairly rapidly a a consensus that etc wanted to stick with proof of work indefinitely but that that uh proof of state was seen as a you know as a centralizing um oligarchic kind of thing that didn't really fit with that with that ethos um but more generally etc is tracking protocol changes in ethereum you know very compatible so there have been forks but not the hard fork along the way because well so yeah i mean they're hard forks but not chain splits got it okay in the in the all protocol updates on ethereum as well you know that they're all hard forks and the old side doesn't actually go away you know you could run a you could run a frontier node if you wanted you can mine on frontier mine the olympic test net mine any of these ones it's just it's just you have had the wither and die because there hasn't been contention um but on etc you have sufficient contention that you had a chain split um but yeah that i guess that's a sort of a bitcoin a thing is saying you know forks are bad right but it's like consensuous hard forks are bad uh hard forks are an upgrade mechanism for the protocol

[[1:07:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4027s) **Jim:**
got it yeah i mean i remember i i had to implement that uh fork a few years ago and it was pretty blatant it was just like take money from here and place it here by the way it didn't bug me but but we had people in the block apps who who thought of it as like a stab to the back they were

[[1:07:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4045s) **Bob:**
like so upset by it yeah well i mean it's literally here's an array of addresses right

[[1:07:29]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4049s) **Jim:**
so fuck with yep i remember that was i i don't remember what else was in there but i remember like the majority of it was just like take a bunch of money and put it into these addresses and that

[[1:07:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4060s) **Bob:**
was the that was the fork yeah you know for this list of addresses replace you know it was yeah you know replace the the bytecode with this other bytecode and also yeah i think the moving was consolidating the child dowells i think i think that's what that was doing so it's like move the money from the child dowells back into the parent dowel and change the bytecode like i think you know if block equals this do a horrible thing

[[1:08:13]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4093s) **Victor:**
but in the UTC world where the Dell hack happened are those funds like did the hacker pull out those funds did okay so like yeah yeah interesting yeah i mean again laura shin

[[1:08:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4110s) **Bob:**
has a great write-up of all of this in her book the cryptopians um including um working out who it probably was oh wow okay well so um she didn't name names in the book but then she did a an article um like on the release day or just before uh naming who she thinks it was so that's an interesting story i can i'll dig out that article and send it to you guys so you can add it to the uh description here cool and but you know bob

[[1:09:05]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4145s) **Victor:**
you're a natural born bridge builder as we said you get along with everyone do you ever see the you know uh valley between ethereum and ethereum classic narrowing or getting better or do you

[[1:09:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4160s) **Bob:**
think it is getting better um i mean the problem that ethereum classic has always had from the time of the split and it comes back to money again like i think that was the one thing that the foundation did wrong um you know like not not talking about the developers or the decision on that or whatever was to only put the money on one side um because what that did is disenfranchised a good chunk of people who had you know invested in the pre-sale who'd been part of that community who'd genuinely been you know actively involved for those first two years and they were just left in the dust it's like you know fuck you guys we don't care what you think goodbye you know and the trademark's going this way and all the funds are going this way and you know and all the developers went that way as well and i mean obviously like the foundation couldn't control that what people choose to work on but what that meant is effectively that group of people got defunded like totally done you i'm sorry my child i i disavow you and i'll kick you out of the house you know forever and i wish i'll never talk to you again um you know i think in retrospect it should have been like okay funding is available for that other fork as well and you may hate us you know and not want to talk to us but i you know i guess it's like you know a child you know whatever teenager i'm fuck you dad i'm leaving home and it's like okay but i'm not going to stop putting aside savings and money for you i you know you might not love me now but you know i'm you're my child too and you know we'll find a way of making it happen you know because same with the c cooperative you know it could have been well when that came into you know into existence the foundation could have gone well okay you know like here's a body that can help and there you go we're going to fund it as well and that there was something a little tiny bit like that with virgil so virgil was also a huge bridge builder between ethereum ethereum classic uh so in 2018 he invited antony busardi who was my predecessor to speak at edcon so this was may 2018 and that was the first ethereum classic talk at an ethereum event you know being nearly two years uh at that point and you know and it was fine and it was cool and everyone was you know everyone was friendly and you know vitalik and various others came to that talk and you know it's all all kind of friendly um and uh and anthony invited me to ethereum classic summit which was in september 2018 so myself and virgil went and spoke at that event um and around that time virgil they somehow they found some etc that the foundation still had you know generally they did a market dump at that time um but there was some stuff that they found you know it's like 50 grand or something like that and so we got that donated to the co-op which was great that was a that was a really nice nice kind of thing but you know it was kind of like here's a little gesture but really i think i think that was a that was a real failing because it was a legitimate um you know irreconcilable difference but but it was made even worse by this you know 100 f purity pledge combined again with all the money's gone so you end up you know a very small community of mainly people who are you know very ideologically outraged by it you know if you've got speculative token holders obviously that you know they're going to stick with ethereum you know what's this other thing there's new thing and there's nothing you know so so that's always been the the issue that the etc's had is you know lack of um you know lack of lack of money and interest really um more recently we've had uh support from bitmain after the merge with ethereum moving to proof-of-stake all of a sudden etc is one of the larger uh mining uh ecosystems so all of a sudden we you know we're very aligned with with with bitmain you know they want to sell asics they want to be using ampool for mining so uh so they're supporting a grant program now um but yeah you know etc is you know it's small um but you have you know you have some people and that's you know that's their that's what they want

[[1:14:22]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4462s) **Victor:**
yeah and as you said like you know like it's broken the mode of like sidechain surviving right like it really like you know it'd be it it's possible you know um

[[1:14:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4474s) **Kieren:**
no sorry go ahead karen i wanted to talk quickly about you know this the definition of success for blockchains market caps um and all that sort of thing and i was looking today because so there is market cap is in the 200 billions um here in classic is still at number 28 which is quite impressive and is you know 2.6 billion in market cap i think market cap is probably more of an indicator of popularity than anything we got a sort of truly long-term you know it's not quite like with companies where market cap is probably a better indicator of how important they are

[[1:15:18]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4518s) **Bob:**
but it is also still and then if you look yeah if you look in coin gecko so ethereum classic is higher than cosmos than filecoin than hedera than internet computer than than aptos than lido um than nia than optimism than arbitrum than the graph you know

[[1:15:44]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4544s) **Kieren:**
um and so i i wanted to to follow you know is market cap a good goal what what is your goal for etc if you were trying to you know make up the gap with ethereum well you know would you

[[1:16:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4560s) **Bob:**
do anything differently i mean i think to do that you just need vast investment into application layer um i mean i think i think that's somewhere where etc really can't compete with many other vc chains you know that have huge treasuries that can be spending you know tens or hundreds of millions on on grant programs you know that's you know we can't we can't compete that way but also it as you say it it's a bit of a vanity metric in a way you know like there are many other vanity metrics that we we commonly see in the space um because yeah you know if you want whatever the fastest chain or the most money or whatever like yeah that's not going to be etc like it can never be etc um but for people that are interested that's not the goal right they uh you know they're they're they're looking for something which is basically like bitcoin plus smart contracts you know with that kind of strong non-intervention kind of bias and also proof of work you know a lot of people see uh you know real value in proof of work and are very skeptical of of proof of existence so

[[1:17:21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4641s) **Kieren:**
you know it's not you know it's not when it takes all um it's it's been interesting just how not a winner takes all the blockchain space has been they've had this they're like cockroaches they just kind of they you know keep going i know they get delisted occasionally but you know how many let's see how many pages you can get to on can we call them tree clippings instead of yeah yeah yeah that's that's quite a number and and very interesting um kind of in and of itself victor you were saying something when i made my comment oh no no i was just saying i um i was

[[1:18:07]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28OPUQP7Wa4&t=4687s) **Victor:**
gonna ask you more questions about um you know the early days of ea but i think we will have to invite you back because i'm pretty sure we could have another um you know another 90-minute conversation on that but it's been great to have you bob as always you're always been a great friend and a wealth of information on the space so thank you for joining us and we hope you'll come back
