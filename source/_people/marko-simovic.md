Marko built out the original continuous integration setup for cpp-ethereum, and maintained a Personal Package Archive (PPA) repository for Debian and Ubuntu distribution of that codebase.

He made commits to [msimovic/ethereum-ppa](https://github.com/msimovic/ethereum-ppa) between [12th February 2014 and 4th March 2014](https://github.com/msimovic/ethereum-ppa/commits/master).

He made commits to cpp-ethereum between [3rd March 2014 and 8th April 2014](https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/commits?author=msimovic).

He was credited in the Acknowledgements section of the Yellow Paper.

He only worked on Ethereum for a very short time, it appears, with Nick Savers, Caktux and Joris Bontje taking over that CI work later in 2014.
