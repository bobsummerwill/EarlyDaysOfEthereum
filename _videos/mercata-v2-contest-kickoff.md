WEBVTT

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:18.765
Okay,

00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:20.606
can anyone confirm that they can see

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:21.407

00:00:32.392 --> 00:00:33.351
Thank you, Michael.

00:00:35.213 --> 00:00:36.533
Can everyone confirm that

00:00:36.573 --> 00:00:38.454
they can see us on YouTube and spaces?

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:20.923
Michael,

00:01:20.962 --> 00:01:22.545
can you confirm you can hear us on

00:01:22.584 --> 00:01:28.031
YouTube?

00:01:28.052 --> 00:01:29.775
You broke up for me quite a lot there,

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:33.278
Victor, when you were speaking.

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:34.760
Okay.

00:02:00.668 --> 00:02:04.293
OK.

00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:06.376
So Jamie, can you post this on our Twitter,

00:02:06.477 --> 00:02:07.197
the YouTube,

00:02:07.378 --> 00:02:10.062
and we'll get started shortly.

00:02:47.418 --> 00:02:48.919
Hey, MK, welcome.

00:02:52.521 --> 00:03:05.332
Glad you could join us.

00:03:05.353 --> 00:03:06.213
We're just gonna wait a few

00:03:06.234 --> 00:03:08.194
more minutes and get everyone in.

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:08.675
So

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:49.339
Okay,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.702
we're just waiting a few more minutes

00:04:50.742 --> 00:04:52.607
for people to kind of start coming in.

00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:54.891
Thank you, everyone for joining us.

00:04:56.113 --> 00:04:57.536
And we are super excited to

00:04:57.596 --> 00:04:58.538
announce this contest.

00:04:58.579 --> 00:04:58.699
So

00:05:43.382 --> 00:05:55.502
Welcome, Yves.

00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:56.122
Stefan

00:06:15.845 --> 00:06:16.685
Do you want to give it maybe

00:06:16.725 --> 00:06:20.928
until ten past, Victor, three minutes?

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:24.031
Sure.

00:06:24.072 --> 00:06:25.052
Nice round number.

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:44.595
So on one of our spaces not

00:06:44.634 --> 00:06:45.814
too long ago where we were

00:06:45.834 --> 00:06:46.875
interviewing Texture,

00:06:47.516 --> 00:06:49.276
he berated us for talking

00:06:49.317 --> 00:06:50.858
about the weather when he joined.

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:52.098
Do you remember that?

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:56.901
We were talking about the

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.242
turns of the season and

00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:00.142
when fall was starting and so on.

00:07:01.543 --> 00:07:02.964
I do not remember that.

00:07:03.685 --> 00:07:04.886
And he said we were old for

00:07:04.906 --> 00:07:06.987
talking about the weather.

00:07:09.177 --> 00:07:11.519
Well, we are old, but you know,

00:07:11.678 --> 00:07:13.420
like I guess in the, I guess.

00:07:17.002 --> 00:07:18.023
We're experienced.

00:07:18.062 --> 00:07:19.824
We're not old.

00:07:25.247 --> 00:07:25.567
Should,

00:07:25.607 --> 00:07:27.007
should we troll them by talking

00:07:27.048 --> 00:07:28.127
about the weather now or not?

00:07:28.608 --> 00:07:28.908
Welcome.

00:07:43.194 --> 00:07:45.033
So just for everyone's information,

00:07:45.334 --> 00:07:46.175
and since we're not going

00:07:46.194 --> 00:07:47.115
to talk about the weather,

00:07:47.574 --> 00:07:49.115
this is our first simulcast.

00:07:49.175 --> 00:07:51.036
It's happening on YouTube

00:07:51.175 --> 00:07:53.136
Live and Twitter Spaces.

00:07:53.615 --> 00:07:54.536
There was some

00:07:55.257 --> 00:07:58.177
behind-the-scenes wiring up of all this.

00:07:58.677 --> 00:08:03.278
And if anyone has poor audio or anything,

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:04.059
please let us know,

00:08:04.098 --> 00:08:06.800
and we'll try and rectify it next time.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.519
So yeah, we're using StreamYard,

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.720
which seems to be sort of

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.440
the best answer there is.

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:14.358
not great either.

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:16.439
Also,

00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:20.322
X do not make it easy to escape their

00:08:20.362 --> 00:08:21.184
walled garden.

00:08:21.663 --> 00:08:22.665
They really want you to do

00:08:22.725 --> 00:08:24.146
everything on spaces.

00:08:25.187 --> 00:08:25.848
There isn't even

00:08:25.908 --> 00:08:26.649
functionality for

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:28.129
downloading the audio

00:08:28.389 --> 00:08:30.932
afterwards natively.

00:08:30.971 --> 00:08:32.573
They do not want you to escape.

00:08:34.916 --> 00:08:35.375
However,

00:08:35.456 --> 00:08:38.339
we found lots of dodgy browser

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:40.080
extensions that allow you to do that.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.841
Um,

00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:46.263
that's and command line tools just

00:08:46.302 --> 00:08:49.825
points out with Sheba prize

00:08:49.884 --> 00:08:53.767
winning Sheba Tarzan in

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:56.589
contest number one and back

00:08:56.849 --> 00:08:57.889
back for more in, uh,

00:08:58.349 --> 00:08:59.610
in this second contest.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:00.750
Yes.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.354
Um, and Justin welcome.

00:09:07.494 --> 00:09:07.793
Okay.

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:09.654
Maybe we start.

00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:10.154
Yep.

00:09:10.174 --> 00:09:11.316
So, so yeah.

00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:14.567
okay hi everyone um good to

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:15.869

simwell I'm the head of

00:09:16.849 --> 00:09:23.173
ecosystem at uh uh at um at

00:09:23.192 --> 00:09:25.855
strata block apps uh victor

00:09:25.894 --> 00:09:27.696
who's with us here is the

00:09:27.856 --> 00:09:29.277
uh chief product officer

00:09:29.317 --> 00:09:32.639
and co-founder um mccarter

00:09:32.659 --> 00:09:36.101
v-two um is the new

00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:38.403
iteration uh of our

00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:40.565
application of our network

00:09:42.884 --> 00:09:45.245
which has been a major focus

00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:46.086
for us this year.

00:09:46.446 --> 00:09:47.927
We spent the vast majority

00:09:47.947 --> 00:09:49.607
of this year rebuilding a

00:09:49.668 --> 00:09:53.809
completely new application experience.

00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:57.331
The current production

00:09:57.412 --> 00:09:59.293
mainnet is more of a sort

00:09:59.673 --> 00:10:02.894
of eBay-ish kind of setup,

00:10:04.736 --> 00:10:05.996
really coming out of an

00:10:06.096 --> 00:10:08.759
earlier period where we were

00:10:09.496 --> 00:10:11.438
uh having a marketplace of

00:10:11.698 --> 00:10:12.559
of kind of like

00:10:13.061 --> 00:10:15.202
collectibles tokenized

00:10:15.263 --> 00:10:17.505
whiskey barrels and other

00:10:17.525 --> 00:10:19.607
things which were more nft

00:10:19.648 --> 00:10:23.272
like um the focus for v two

00:10:23.412 --> 00:10:25.634
is really about high

00:10:25.654 --> 00:10:30.240
quality hard assets uh specifically um

00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:32.241
Gold and silver.

00:10:32.601 --> 00:10:33.062
Hey, Bob.

00:10:34.023 --> 00:10:35.063
We're getting some feedback

00:10:35.083 --> 00:10:36.605
that your audio is coming

00:10:36.664 --> 00:10:38.206
in choppy for some reason,

00:10:38.365 --> 00:10:41.268
but mine seems to be okay.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.730
So why don't I take it over

00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:44.549
from what you said?

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.231
So as Bob was saying,

00:10:48.052 --> 00:10:49.933
VTU is really an iteration

00:10:49.974 --> 00:10:51.475
of what we were doing before, you know?

00:10:51.815 --> 00:10:54.580
We were kind of offering a

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.485
lot of different RWAs before.

00:10:57.806 --> 00:10:59.649
And VTU is our way to kind

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.573
of really focus on

00:11:02.283 --> 00:11:04.466
the ability to bring

00:11:04.525 --> 00:11:07.028
real-world assets and lend

00:11:07.149 --> 00:11:08.850
and borrow on those assets.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.913
So one of the things that

00:11:11.052 --> 00:11:12.053
we're going to be testing

00:11:12.495 --> 00:11:13.895
in this iteration of the

00:11:13.936 --> 00:11:15.658
contest is really how it

00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:17.759
interacts with the external world,

00:11:18.081 --> 00:11:18.902
including things like

00:11:18.922 --> 00:11:19.863
bridging out and bridging

00:11:19.982 --> 00:11:21.203
in these different assets.

00:11:21.583 --> 00:11:23.046
And it's really interesting because

00:11:23.546 --> 00:11:24.605
One of the things I think

00:11:24.625 --> 00:11:26.326
that stands out in our

00:11:26.366 --> 00:11:27.567
positioning in terms of the

00:11:27.647 --> 00:11:30.128
RWA space is most RWA

00:11:30.168 --> 00:11:31.467
projects seem to really be

00:11:31.508 --> 00:11:33.328
trying to focus on getting

00:11:33.369 --> 00:11:35.009
degensed by RWAs.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:36.590
We're focused on people who

00:11:36.789 --> 00:11:39.350
already have RWAs, things like gold,

00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:41.250
silver, US dollars,

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.672
and bring that into the

00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:46.393
crypto ecosystem and the DeFi ecosystem.

00:11:46.432 --> 00:11:48.352
So that's really what we

00:11:48.413 --> 00:11:50.234
want to kind of test in terms of

00:11:50.994 --> 00:11:52.096
this overall contest.

00:11:52.196 --> 00:11:52.416
Now,

00:11:52.976 --> 00:11:54.278
what you're seeing on your screen

00:11:54.318 --> 00:11:58.565
right now is a overview of

00:11:58.625 --> 00:12:00.506
the new v two application.

00:12:00.626 --> 00:12:03.331
It's been basically the

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.351
focus of our efforts

00:12:04.371 --> 00:12:05.153
throughout this year.

00:12:05.634 --> 00:12:06.875
And what

00:12:08.004 --> 00:12:10.606
There have been significant changes to it,

00:12:10.726 --> 00:12:12.528
which I'll show in one second,

00:12:14.149 --> 00:12:15.791
from the earlier iteration

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.673
of our contest in July.

00:12:19.173 --> 00:12:20.333
Thank you for everyone that

00:12:20.374 --> 00:12:21.394
provided feedback.

00:12:22.134 --> 00:12:23.436
That was immensely useful.

00:12:23.475 --> 00:12:24.517
We took as much of that

00:12:24.537 --> 00:12:26.418
feedback as we could to

00:12:26.498 --> 00:12:27.778
bring you this new version

00:12:27.818 --> 00:12:28.500
of the contest.

00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:31.081
Now, in this version of the contest,

00:12:31.982 --> 00:12:33.565
there are still going to be

00:12:33.605 --> 00:12:35.285
three prizes as there were before,

00:12:35.666 --> 00:12:37.107
but they're for slightly

00:12:37.148 --> 00:12:37.828
different things.

00:12:38.188 --> 00:12:40.971
So we will have a prize for

00:12:41.152 --> 00:12:42.952
the best trading award.

00:12:42.993 --> 00:12:45.755
So whoever has the total net balance wins.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.942
of total number of assets and, um,

00:12:50.822 --> 00:12:52.644
based on all of their activities.

00:12:52.724 --> 00:12:54.644
So that will be a prize and

00:12:54.725 --> 00:12:55.965
we've doubled the prizes.

00:12:55.985 --> 00:12:57.865
So that would be five hundred, uh,

00:12:58.066 --> 00:13:00.067
USDC plus Cata points.

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:02.067
And then we will have,

00:13:02.347 --> 00:13:05.509
instead of like just offering bug prices,

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:06.309
we have a.

00:13:06.812 --> 00:13:08.572
recommended improvement prize.

00:13:08.893 --> 00:13:10.153
So for technical people who

00:13:10.173 --> 00:13:11.913
are not that into trading

00:13:12.014 --> 00:13:13.254
please provide us your

00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:14.775
recommendations on improvements.

00:13:15.115 --> 00:13:17.996
That prize is also a five

00:13:18.037 --> 00:13:20.317
hundred USDC plus COTA points.

00:13:20.658 --> 00:13:22.418
And then we have an export prize.

00:13:22.778 --> 00:13:24.360
So if anyone finds an

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.081
exploit that could possibly

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.461
steal funds from the system,

00:13:29.878 --> 00:13:31.359
we are offering fifteen

00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:33.279
hundred for that price and

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.321
kind of points as well.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.581
So that's what we're

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.822
offering for this one.

00:13:38.383 --> 00:13:40.604
The way the process works is

00:13:40.663 --> 00:13:41.504
slightly different.

00:13:41.524 --> 00:13:42.304
So I just want to kind of

00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:44.346
walk everyone through that a little bit.

00:13:44.706 --> 00:13:46.748
So for the trading price,

00:13:47.808 --> 00:13:49.450
what we are doing is we are

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.071
first providing you assets

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.331
that will be on support

00:13:53.371 --> 00:13:54.412
there and you'll have to

00:13:54.472 --> 00:13:55.793
bridge those assets in.

00:13:56.254 --> 00:13:57.313
So if you look here,

00:13:57.333 --> 00:13:58.595
I'm going to show you how you do that.

00:13:58.972 --> 00:14:00.774
You go to the deposits page

00:14:01.293 --> 00:14:03.394
and we're providing two

00:14:03.595 --> 00:14:05.274
contest specific assets.

00:14:05.754 --> 00:14:09.876
One we call MF for Mercada F

00:14:10.256 --> 00:14:11.876
and you bring that in by bridging.

00:14:11.996 --> 00:14:14.677
So you use the Sepolia and

00:14:14.697 --> 00:14:17.278
you can bridge it in on the MF network.

00:14:17.678 --> 00:14:17.899
Now,

00:14:18.139 --> 00:14:20.921
when you see this and when you bridge

00:14:20.961 --> 00:14:22.201
it and connect it to your wallet,

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.042
you'll see two confirmations and.

00:14:25.822 --> 00:14:28.503
From, you know, say your external wallet.

00:14:28.682 --> 00:14:30.043
I personally use MetaMask.

00:14:30.082 --> 00:14:31.863
So if it's on your MetaMask wallet,

00:14:31.982 --> 00:14:33.263
you'll see two confirmations.

00:14:33.783 --> 00:14:35.683
One to verify that the funds

00:14:35.724 --> 00:14:36.724
are available to send.

00:14:37.083 --> 00:14:37.903
And then the second to

00:14:38.004 --> 00:14:39.684
actually bridge in the transaction.

00:14:40.184 --> 00:14:42.125
And then after that,

00:14:43.705 --> 00:14:46.145
it will be converted into FST.

00:14:46.466 --> 00:14:47.346
So it will be bridged,

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:48.605
wrapped on the system,

00:14:48.645 --> 00:14:49.706
and then be converted into

00:14:50.966 --> 00:14:52.866
FST where you can start to trade with it.

00:14:53.409 --> 00:14:55.270
The second way to bring in

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.351
is to convert tab.

00:14:56.692 --> 00:14:58.633
So what the convert tab is,

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:01.075
it brings in stable coins,

00:15:01.375 --> 00:15:04.177
like ultimately,

00:15:04.616 --> 00:15:06.398
our version of a stable

00:15:06.437 --> 00:15:07.678
coin for the contest is

00:15:07.719 --> 00:15:09.899
called M USDC that we will

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.400
provide to every contest participant.

00:15:12.942 --> 00:15:13.101
And

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.581
When you bring it in,

00:15:14.721 --> 00:15:17.724
it automatically converts into USDST.

00:15:18.183 --> 00:15:20.446
So those are how you kind of

00:15:21.466 --> 00:15:24.347
start bringing assets into your account.

00:15:24.707 --> 00:15:26.389
And then from there you can start trading.

00:15:26.789 --> 00:15:28.951
So you can borrow against

00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:30.292
those assets by offering

00:15:30.312 --> 00:15:31.232
them as collateral.

00:15:31.852 --> 00:15:33.053
And once you,

00:15:33.073 --> 00:15:34.695
you can see here that I can

00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:37.576
supply collateral with my FSD,

00:15:37.876 --> 00:15:39.317
and then I can borrow against it.

00:15:40.038 --> 00:15:42.360
I can swap those out for other assets.

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:44.139
And one thing that's really

00:15:44.158 --> 00:15:46.879
important is that everyone

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.441
for the contest will have

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.221
to own at least one of the major assets.

00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:59.423
So you will have to have USDST, WBTCST,

00:15:59.842 --> 00:16:02.783
ETHST, GOLDST, and SILVST.

00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:04.124
You will have to have one of

00:16:04.203 --> 00:16:06.183
each of those assets to be

00:16:07.065 --> 00:16:08.565
eligible for the trading prize.

00:16:09.125 --> 00:16:09.966
And then you can also

00:16:10.486 --> 00:16:12.309
participate in the pools as well.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:13.711
So you can either provide

00:16:13.751 --> 00:16:15.394
liquidity to the pools or

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:18.580
and also liquidate people

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.543
whose positions that are

00:16:20.582 --> 00:16:21.624
coming under risk.

00:16:22.044 --> 00:16:23.606
So that's how this contest will work.

00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:26.232
And one other thing we want

00:16:26.253 --> 00:16:28.573
to mention is that to kind

00:16:28.614 --> 00:16:33.336
of give a good simulation of real life,

00:16:33.876 --> 00:16:35.977
throughout the contest on

00:16:36.018 --> 00:16:37.118
the Telegram channel,

00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:39.259
we will announce special

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.039
events that will happen

00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:43.562
that will impact various

00:16:43.581 --> 00:16:46.182
things on the contest and

00:16:46.202 --> 00:16:48.183
the prices of assets on the contest.

00:16:48.563 --> 00:16:50.245
So we will announce events.

00:16:50.605 --> 00:16:51.125
um,

00:16:51.164 --> 00:16:54.166
sort of sudden airdrops where the first

00:16:54.186 --> 00:16:54.865
couple of people that

00:16:54.926 --> 00:16:56.907
respond will get additional tokens.

00:16:57.226 --> 00:16:58.307
We are announced sudden

00:16:58.346 --> 00:17:01.528
price shifts and we will announce also,

00:17:01.548 --> 00:17:04.968
uh, You know, other things that, you know,

00:17:05.008 --> 00:17:06.189
some positions might be

00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:08.328
liquidatable on the contest.

00:17:08.749 --> 00:17:11.130
So basically all of those

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:12.289
things are going to come at

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.691
random times throughout the day.

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:15.651
So stay on your toes.

00:17:16.517 --> 00:17:19.357
make sure you sign up to the channel,

00:17:19.857 --> 00:17:21.597
contest channel on Telegram,

00:17:21.857 --> 00:17:24.818
which is called CrowdLVT contest, nine,

00:17:24.858 --> 00:17:26.319
seventeen to nine, twenty three.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.019
And then watch out for those

00:17:30.059 --> 00:17:31.580
because they could come at any time.

00:17:32.101 --> 00:17:33.760
So with that,

00:17:33.961 --> 00:17:36.041
I think that's a high level

00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:37.241
overview of the contest.

00:17:38.883 --> 00:17:39.143
Bob,

00:17:39.383 --> 00:17:41.022
not sure if your audio is working better,

00:17:41.083 --> 00:17:42.483
but maybe you can chip in

00:17:42.503 --> 00:17:43.903
here and just test it out.

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:46.724
Yeah, I'll try.

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:48.486
Just let me say a little bit,

00:17:48.625 --> 00:17:50.826
and maybe somebody can

00:17:50.886 --> 00:17:53.448
confirm if that audio is

00:17:53.528 --> 00:17:57.391
choppy or not still.

00:17:57.431 --> 00:18:01.192
Have a look, maybe, Jeremy or Michael.

00:18:01.292 --> 00:18:01.593
Okay.

00:18:03.334 --> 00:18:03.953
Unfortunately,

00:18:03.973 --> 00:18:04.954
it sounds like your audio is

00:18:04.974 --> 00:18:06.234
still a little bit choppy today.

00:18:06.695 --> 00:18:08.096
We will work out the audio

00:18:08.175 --> 00:18:09.936
issues for later, but...

00:18:12.609 --> 00:18:15.652
Yes, we'll get you some wired headphones,

00:18:15.672 --> 00:18:15.892
Bob.

00:18:16.251 --> 00:18:20.415
I think it is a technology

00:18:20.455 --> 00:18:21.016
problem right now.

00:18:21.455 --> 00:18:23.637
So we look forward,

00:18:23.698 --> 00:18:25.700
the contest will run until

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:27.661
the following Tuesday at five PM.

00:18:28.122 --> 00:18:29.762
So everyone,

00:18:30.888 --> 00:18:32.369
We look forward to seeing

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.692
you participate in the contest.

00:18:35.051 --> 00:18:36.432
We look forward to seeing

00:18:37.093 --> 00:18:38.153
any of your comments.

00:18:38.574 --> 00:18:40.075
And please provide whatever

00:18:40.134 --> 00:18:41.715
feedback that you have on

00:18:41.736 --> 00:18:42.676
the Telegram feed.

00:18:43.798 --> 00:18:44.978
Your feedback so far has

00:18:45.018 --> 00:18:46.118
been immensely helpful.

00:18:46.578 --> 00:18:47.799
And I think this is going to

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.662
really make Mercado,

00:18:50.721 --> 00:18:52.682
Strato Mercado into an amazing product.

00:18:53.042 --> 00:18:54.364
So thank you very much.

00:18:54.704 --> 00:18:56.986
And with that, happy hunting, everyone.

00:18:57.006 --> 00:18:58.446
Take care.

00:19:16.259 --> 00:19:17.503
Has this stream stopped?
