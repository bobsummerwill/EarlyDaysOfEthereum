Zsolt has known Daniel Nagy since they met at high school in 1994.

Viktor Tron was the first hire at the Ethereum Foundation, in February 2014.  Daniel started learning about Ethereum in April 2014 and then Daniel and Viktor

Daniel and Viktor started working on Swarm during the course of 2014 and Daniel presented the concept at DEVCON0.

  Some friends of Daniel learnt about Ethereum first.  In Daniel's


So my Ethereum story is this: i knew Daniel since 1994 (high school) and some people from his circles knew about Ethereum first. He and Viktor (who was already working on Geth already by then) went to DEVCON0 (i wasn't there yet), where they pitched the p2p storage project idea and Daniel got hired too (oct 2014 probably). Then Daniel involved me, i started implementing the basics of Swarm in nov 2014. Then i joined a Geth team meetup in feb 2015 in Amsterdam where Jeff hired me too. My contract started on 1st march 2015 but Jeff said i am not hired to do Swarm because there are other important things to do and i should design and implement a light client protocol. So I've never actually been officially involved with Ethersphere even though i'm probably listed as a contributor here and there.
Since then i never left geth, one i had a 5 month sabbatical when i did not invoice but  other than that i've been continuously on the geth team and paid by the ef since then.


, with an initial focus on the Light Client sub-protocol, but also on Swarm and the Geth client in general.

He cofounded Ethersphere in Budapest in 2015 with Viktor Trón, and Daniel Nagy as an umbrella for their development activities, primarily on Swarm.
