Unfortunately we were not able to secure the venue for devcon one in London on the dates desired (October 5th-8th). As a consequence we are postponing the event until further notice.  Please do not make travel plans at this time. Updates will be forthcoming on the [devcon one website](http://devcon.ethdev.com/) . Please standby for further information.
