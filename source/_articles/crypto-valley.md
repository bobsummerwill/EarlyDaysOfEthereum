During discussions about the Ethereum Foundation's setup, Mihai Alisie suggested the term "Crypto Valley" to refer to Zug region. This name was inspired by the area's emerging cluster of Bitcoin and blockchain firms, including early consultants and lawyers already present in Zug.

The Ethereum Foundation established operations in Zug in July 2014 and then launched its $18M crowdsale, which became a blueprint for crypto fundraising.

Bitcoin Suisse, co-founded by Fabian Hediger, provided advisory services and further solidified Zug's role. 

Within three years, around 40 crypto foundations were established in Zug alone—far more than any other Swiss canton - drawn by the supportive regulatory environment from FINMA and local authorities.
