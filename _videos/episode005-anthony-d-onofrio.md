### <a id="introductions-small-talk"></a>Introductions & Small Talk

[01:18] Bob: You hear me?

[01:20] Kieren: Yes I can.

[01:29] Kieren: Excellent.

[01:31] Bob: Happy shadow spaces.

[01:49] Texture: GM.

[01:57] Texture: What's up guys?

[02:02] Kieren: How are you?

[02:04] Texture: I'm good.

[02:07] Texture: First week of September. I'm not sure if it's the officially the first week of fall. But nevertheless, super excited for a new month. I know at Strato, we have a very exciting month ahead.

[02:28] Kieren: I think technically fall starts on the either 21st or 22nd but spiritually it starts after Labor day of course.

[02:38] Bob: Yeah.

[02:41] Bob: I don't know if anyone has a, you know, white suit, but you can.

[02:46] Kieren: I actually sort of have a white suit. Uh, and uh, you can no longer wear those already.

[02:54] Bob: My might have to see that. That

[02:58] Bob: White suit's pretty pretty nice.

[03:01] Kieren: I may have a photo. I think it's been worn to two sort of summer weddings and that's the only time it's been. Um but I can probably dig one up for you Jamie.

[03:15] Texture: Yeah.

[03:19] Bob: Texture, welcome.

[03:22] Texture: Oh. We had him, we lost him.

[03:24] Bob: We had him.

[03:38] Kieren: Yeah. Yeah, spiritually fall is here along with football to the behest of our European counterparts.

[03:54] Kieren: Uh, by the way for space's resiliency, um Chat GPT is recommending two co-hosts up front. Now, do we already have the two or can you add another one?

[04:05] Kieren: Yes. You and Bob are co-hosts.

[04:09] Kieren: Okay. just appears a speaker to me. maybe it appears as co-host to Bob on Bob's side. Bob, are you the co-host successfully?

[04:17] Bob: It appears so.

[04:19] Kieren: Ah, I see it now. Okay. fantastic.

[04:32] Bob: Can you hear me? All right, cool.

[04:34] Kieren: All right. Very very kind of cool August um for for those of us who spent some of it in New York, like August is supposed to be hot and it mostly wasn't. Like the there's supposed to be a sharp transition heading into the fall, but it feels like it kind of started early this year. I don't know what's going on.

[04:55] Kieren: Yeah, completely agree. A lot of long sleeves and sweatshirts during the night. A bit cooler. Is he coming?

[05:09] Texture: You guys are old, been around talking about the weather.

[05:14] Kieren: We're waiting for you.

[05:15] Bob: Well, I'm here.

[05:17] Kieren: Even better.

[05:19] Kieren: Welcome.

[05:20] Texture: What's up?

[05:22] Kieren: GM. Yeah, great great to kick this off. Um I'll I'll hand the mic over to Bob, but I just want to pay my compliments to your PFP texture. It's it's quite the good quite a good one. So, welcome.

[05:37] Texture: Thanks. You own a texture punk?

[05:39] Kieren: I do not, but I saw a few folks with them and uh obviously noticed yours. So uh might might have to uh might have to get one.

[05:49] Texture: It was a joke because I thought punks were ugly. so I made myself a better one and then a friend asked me to make her one and then somebody else and then asked me to make one and then like 30 people later, I was like, I should just fucking make a little thing where they can make their own. and then um

[06:06] Texture: uh then then my buddy started a Discord and 10,000 people showed up and I was like, fuck. It's some good lore. That's some great lore right there.

[06:17] Texture: I thought it was going to be me and my 100 friends.

[06:25] Kieren: Accidental success. Fantastic.

[06:27] Bob: Mm.

### <a id="texture-background"></a>Texture's Background: Peace, Love, Human & Decentralized Dance Party

[06:32] Bob: Right. Well, let's get going, eh. So Hi texture.

[06:36] Texture: I haven't heard.

[06:37] Bob: How are you? It's been a while.

[06:39] Texture: It's been a long time.

[06:42] Bob: Always good to hear your voice.

[06:43] Bob: When I think of you, the first thing I think of is love.

[06:48] Texture: Oh.

[06:50] Bob: And something I'd spotted going through making my notes is your medium is called peace, love revolution.

[07:00] Texture: Yes.

[07:01] Bob: So, what's the story there?

[07:04] Texture: So, you know, uh, I was kind of, I wouldn't say a hippie, I didn't dress like a hippie. I didn't really hang out with hippies, but I had taken some psychedelics and when I was a kid and I had some experiences and uh, you know, kind of drove my passion for uh, you know, doing good things and spreading love in the world. I know people that probably follow me are like, what the fuck? He just called people retards all day. Um, yeah, but I mean I'm on Twitter. I don't know. It's full of retards.

[07:33] Texture: Um, so I started this group called peace love human because uh I was like sitting in a shitty basement apartment in San Francisco and uh was watching the news and I was thing how religions got all fucked up and I was like, what if there was like a religion that didn't have any beliefs and we just went out and did nice shit. So for like three years of my life, I was just like homeless and had no job and wanted the Earth setting up like free hug uh events and like other stuff just to make people smile because like, you know, making people feel loved or making people happy was not like a quantifiable metric but making people smile was. so that was that was what I did for my early 20s.

[08:18] Texture: Um so that's what I was doing then. uh community building. I accidentally started a cult. And when I realized that it was a cult, I shut it down.

[08:28] Bob: Okay.

[08:30] Texture: But it it helped me, you know, it was my first foray into cult building, which obviously uh Right useful. I took into my role in Ethereum and I feel like the Ethereum cult is going pretty well.

[08:42] Bob: I seem to remember at some point you told me that you've probably hugged a thousand random people on the street giving away hugs.

[08:49] Texture: Oh, a thousand. a thousand in a day, probably probably a 100,000 more or more. Yeah. It was it was nice. It was it was good. I mean, I could waste this entire thing telling that story. but that's that's probably not what people want to hear.

[09:11] Bob: Uh, I mean I can see why decentralized dance party uh also appealed to you on that score.

[09:18] Texture: Yeah, that's so um DDP uh Gary, the guy who runs uh that, he um he came and stayed at my apartment in Brooklyn and uh we had this uh three story loft in a warehouse and we'd let people come crash and he came through and that's how I met him and I've I've done three or four of them. I was I was uh what is it at it's Tom, I was Tom. So Tom is like a rotating. I was Tom one time. so that was fun. I had to shave my beard, I had a mustache, I looked funny.

[09:54] Bob: Oh I'll drop some some links on Twitter for that for anyone who hasn't seen uh decentralized dance party or you can go and uh have a have a Google on your own. It is uh it's quite exceptional.

[10:07] Texture: It's funny. I had uh no I didn't really understand the decentralized thing at that point. I was not really involved. so he was kind of ahead of the curve on that with me.

[10:19] Bob: For sure. So yeah, that's Gary Chance who is a fellow Vancouver right with me. Um he was uh funny enough in in in a photo for the very first item I could find about Vancouver decentral. you know, the whole uh decentral Toronto, Vancouver thing, Gary was in that photo for the first one. Um maybe well known as well now for for Doge McLaren. So there is the Dodge wrapped McLaren which uh travels around many uh many conferences where they can get uh financial support for that. Um Yeah, Gary's a great guy.

[11:03] Texture: It's pretty fun.

### <a id="the-vision"></a>The Vision: Initial Thoughts on Ethereum

[11:05] Bob: Um so tell me about your the vision that you had which was then the same as the white paper because on the on the Twitter thread, I was wrongly saying your mind was blown by the Ethereum white paper where actually what happened was that you'd you'd had a vision of this about a week before and then the white paper landed on your on your lap. So what the hell was that about?

[11:40] Texture: Yeah, so what actually happened was I had a roommate uh for years ago, like years when I lived in New York and he had tried to get me into Bitcoin when it was a dollar and I said, I don't this is like internet nerd money. I'm like a love revolutionary. I don't give a shit about this. Um and then he kept bothering me about it for years and then it hit 1400 and I was kind of humble enough to be like, well, if other people think it's worth something, I guess it is. But um he had he had texted me and he said, listen man, I want you to listen to this podcast and it was the let's talk Bitcoin podcast with Adam B. LaVine and Andreas Antonopolis. And um so I had given up working in tech because my my arms had given out. I was a programmer and designer for, you know, a very long time and uh I had I had started making cannabis edibles in California because uh, seemed like a a an industry that was going to be um something pretty easy to get into like the marketing, the production, everything was shit and I was pretty good at it. So uh, yeah, so I had I had a girlfriend who was about four hours away um and I would go visit her on the weekends and I so I threw the Bitcoin podcast on. I ate one of my candies and uh, don't drive stoned kids. But um yeah, uh on the way there, I was listening and listening to the podcast and my my brain just kind of tuned in and I had I like what can I can only describe it as like a biblical vision. I would say like before that I wouldn't have understood what that meant, but like just this massive data download into my head where I could see like basically see the future, like visually like I just saw the whole thing playing out in front of me and I was like, oh shit, you know, Bitcoin I'm I'm still not particularly fascinated by but the blockchain, um idea has has has an amazing amount of potential. Um and I kind of saw how how it could help you know, people coordinate. Um and so it just kind of it struck me so much that uh I was like, I got to go talk to Adam. Um I got to go meet the people who did this podcast because at that time it was the only Bitcoin podcast and I thought anybody who wanted attention for what they were doing uh would probably contact them. So the buddy that had told me to listen to the podcast randomly came into town three days later. and I said, hey man, I I've been thinking a lot. I listened to the podcast, I have a lot of idea. I need to meet uh Adam. I need to meet and he goes, uh, well, actually I'm flying out in a couple days to go meet him. we have a meeting scheduled. He's in Washington celebrating his birthday with his wife. Um, and I said, no, no, no, no, we're getting in my car right now, I'm driving. I'm driving us there, I'm going. Um I'm going to go talk to him. And he's like, what? really? And I'm like, yeah, fucking cancel your ticket. Like we're getting in my car right now. So we drove like 20 hours or whatever to like Washington State. I walked in. Um pretty much, I don't know what their meeting was about, but I pretty much just took Adam to the side and we ended up sitting in his hot tub on his balcony for like nine hours just talking. Um and it was a really cool, it was a really cool uh you know, discussion and I said, you know, what what I want from you is I want you to tell me anybody you know who's who's working on anything like this. And he said, well, you know, do you know who Vitalik is? I said, man, no I'm not in crypto at all. I'm not in Bitcoin. I don't know, I don't know anybody, I don't know anything. Um and he said, uh, well, he just sent me this white paper a few days ago. I can like I can forward it to you. um and can you guys still hear me?

[15:22] Bob: Yep, yep.

### <a id="early-days-skype-group"></a>The Early Days: The Skype Group and White Paper

[15:23] Texture: All right, my little thing stopped showing. So then, um yeah, so he forward me the white paper. I looked at it. Um you know, to me it wasn't as comprehensive as the vision that I had, but I thought, you know, this kids met, you know, right? Like what are the chances that all this stuff lined up like this. So, uh, I said, yeah, uh, make the intro. And so we started a Skype group, uh, and uh, you know, Adam was there. I remember Charles was there. uh Vitalik was there, I was there. and it's it it it became the official uh Ethereum Skype group. um and just kind of grew from there. So, then you know, it was like Was that the water cooler?

[16:01] Texture: No, no, no. Water cooler is something I made later because people That's later. Yeah, so that was just the the literal like main Ethereum Skype channel that we used to communicate for the first, I don't know, long time.

[16:17] Bob: Right. Right.

[16:18] Texture: Um No, water cooler was something I created later because actually I don't remember why. Um people were I had I guess I was kind of like it was off topic or whatever probably. Well, maybe, but like I I was kind of like the dude that everybody trusted and so like whenever anybody wanted to talk to somebody they would come talk to me, which is why I like got so much information about what was going on all the time. But yeah, so I think it was just an extension of that. like people talked to me all the time. Let me create a little place for us to shoot the shit.

[16:50] Bob: Got me. So when when do you think you had that trip to Washington? When do you think that would have been?

[16:58] Texture: I'm horrible with with time um and dates. Uh especially during that time, you know, when you're like a free flowing hippie dude. Yeah. Um but it was I would say it was the week after the the week, week and a half after Vitalik sent the white paper out to right, right. his original group of people to get the uh feedback on.

[17:21] Bob: Yeah. so it might even have been during November still.

[17:26] Texture: Yeah, I mean it was as early as you could get. I mean, just by happenstance, just by the timing, I was there the the basically the moment we were coming together.

[17:37] Bob: Yeah. Yeah. So amazing. because yeah, so I was able to find that uh the video of uh of you and Vitalik at the uh at the at the salon uh which was uh beaming into the Vancouver central there and that was December the 15th that was.

[17:57] Texture: Yeah.

[17:58] Bob: You did that one.

[18:00] Texture: Yeah, so we had been yeah, I mean again, the timing, the timing I don't know but yeah, obviously by that time we had been doing it for a minute.

[18:10] Bob: Yeah. I mean the funny thing was looking at that, that's before there was any code any public code at least. There wasn't even any Python code from Vitalik published at that point and Gav and Jeff were weeks away still.

[18:25] Texture: Yeah, and Jeff Jeff uh to my understanding, just read the white paper and started coding it up on his own and said, hey, I've got this go implementation.

[18:34] Bob: Yeah, pretty much and and the same for same for Gav. They were both at the very tail end of December, basically like a Christmas project kind of deal for the for the pair of them.

[18:45] Texture: Yeah, no, it was great. You know, and I I've been a developer my whole life since I was a kid. Um and since I'd quit coding, I wasn't really sure where I fit in, you know, but I was really happy when all these other people like got in. I guess maybe if I'd have dropped some code and gotten a lot more ETH, I would have been cool, but whatever.

[19:07] Bob: So I mean um to you at that point, like what was Ethereum? Like what was this this vision and like what were you thinking that that could unfold to be, you know, what what was the what was the the the the kernel of that.

[19:27] Texture: Yeah, so I mean um it's so hard to remember those days. There's so much on top of it now. Um, you know, I remember the general vibe was just a technology that would allow people to coordinate, to to encode value, to I mean, you know, like just at all dimensions. things that that haven't even come to fruition yet. things that people aren't even thinking about because so much of it is going to scale just like fundraising, fundraising locally, like just coordinating anything. I mean, it was it was just the the whole world. like just imagining every single system being replaced by this decentralized coordination structure that that gives the the you know, some some 11-year-old kid in you know, Bangalore could create the next, you know, technical development um and and you know, I think that kind of platform um is just something that seemed really empowering. Um so, you know, a lot of idealism, you know, uh obviously real life as it's played out is a lot a lot messier and a lot um different from how we how we imagined it, but a lot of idealistic things. a lot of like very much uh just just really coordination. and and that's a really shitty description of the vision that I had because it was so deep and so multi-dimensional and um Yeah. but yeah.

[21:02] Bob: Social operating system is something I've seen you say on a few occasions.

[21:06] Texture: Yeah, I mean um yeah, just the there's so many dimensions to it but yeah, I mean a social operating system for allowing people to encode their values or encode um yeah, literally their values, anything with value, um creating incentive structures, um contracts that that uh that that are enforced at the exact level that um they were designed to. Um which none of that, you know, all that sounds really technical and and unsexy but to me it was really about the impact, you know, what it what happens when you empower people um to to be able to to create value in their local communities or or encode value in ways they haven't been able to. What happens when, you know, equity in your company can be um easily uh trade you know, just all of these things. Just what what happens when you can do that to houses and local businesses and local communities.

### <a id="technical-idealism-ux"></a>The Problem with Technical Idealism & User Experience

[22:08] Bob: Yeah, I mean I I I think in my sort of thinking in those early days, it was an awful lot about empowerment and about, you know, giving giving people the ability to control their own destiny, right?

[22:20] Texture: Yeah.

[22:21] Bob: Um and and something I've repeatedly thought was was like um if you think about the uh what's it called? The pyramid of needs? What's it called? I forget the Maslow.

[22:33] Kieren: The hierarchy.

[22:34] Bob: Yeah, Mazlow's right. Mazlow's hierarchy of needs, you know, I remember a number of times saying, you know, it's frankly obscene given all the resources that we have in the world and how, you know, how how much more there is than was in previous years. It's obscene that people should be like worried about housing or education or health care or you know, just these basic things, right?

[23:04] Texture: Yeah.

[23:04] Bob: And how wonderful would it be if you could like yank up that base layer a little bit so that people are not like living in this fearful place of powerlessness.

[23:15] Texture: Yeah.

[23:16] Bob: But instead can be like not worrying about that shit and not having to make these compromised bad decisions and everything. Yeah. But just if you could do what you love, what a what a world that would be?

[23:33] Texture: Yeah, and I'm a lot less idealistic about it now after the last decade um for a lot of reasons, but you know, there the marshmallow test is real and um you can create really good technologies and really good user experiences and as many guard rails as you can for people, but at the end of the day, there's motherfuckers that are going to eat the marshmallow before they even hear the rules, you know? And then they'll do it again and again. So I you know, I think there's a lot of it's it's not that I think the problems are unsolvable, but they're yeah. you know, the idea that it's something from above being imposed down, um you know, despite the fact that the system seemed to be that way, I I think a lot of it is just the the the the love of complexity of modern life relative to the average intelligence is um it's just it's it's a wide gap and there's a lot of I mean, I don't know, I could talk about that for fucking 10 hours too. So um, yeah, but Well I mean I I guess I I guess something that I saw in those early days of Ethereum as well was a real um, kind of almost like uh allergic reaction to anything that looked like organization or hierarchy or structure. Uh you know, just like this total flip to the opposite side, right, everything's got to be flat and open and, you know, everything, everyone involved with everything, which is just completely impractical for actually organizing or doing anything. Um Yeah. and I think it came it just it's just nutty. So, but then it's like I I realized it's like hierarchy isn't the problem, being trapped in a hierarchy where it's to your detriment and you can't get out is the problem.

[25:23] Texture: Yeah, and Yeah, and a lot of and I think a lot of times what happens in that is smart people, you know, smart people don't really they don't really understand not smart people. And so what happens is we we are born into a world where these pre-existing hierarchies exist and they've you know, to some degree or another um, you know, kind of persisted through through generations after generation and then we come in and we're like, why am I at the bottom of this hierarchy? I'm smart. We're all too smart for this. And then they try to like, you know, they try to create new systems assuming that everyone is approximately like them and then, you know, I've I've been through so many because again, coming through the hippie shit. I was in the Bay area for a long time. You see so many people think that they're the first person ever think of flat hierarchies and how it's going to be so much better. And at the end of the day, man, like that's fine if you want to talk all the fucking time and you want to argue and you want to get nothing done. But at the end of the day, you know, hierarchy is an information structure and it's also an accountability structure. And so as long as there's accountability at the top and as long as the information is flowing correctly and as long as the outputs are, you know, optimal to some degree, then it's the best you're going to get and and it's it doesn't mean we can't continually improve. Obviously, life gets better and we we have an obligation, you know, I think when you're creating things, it's not just the creating things and I think this is a big problem that still exists in crypto. People think if you build it, they will come. You can't just build it. You have to build it and then you have to make it a button, a single button. It has to be so simple, your grandma can do it and and not destroy her life. Um, and so it is this kind of perpetual attempt to take these complex structures, simplify them so that everyone has access to them, but through that simplification, not creating these kind of hells that that no one can get out of. Um, and I think, you know, just because of the the the rate of technological development and and the nature of um, you know, economic progress, our opportunities as people trapped in those systems is is to build new systems, but ultimately we're going to come face to face with the reality of why those systems were set up the way they were and understand that the best we can really hope for in most instances is an optimization of that. We can try to make it simpler, more efficient, better and more adaptable, but those are a lot of dimensions that any one of them out of um out of out of sync is going to is going to create either more problems um or the system itself will collapse, right? And you know, if the system doesn't exist then nobody gets nobody gets anything.

### <a id="palace-politics-neurodiversity"></a>Palace Politics & Neurodiversity in Early Crypto

[28:19] Bob: Yeah. I mean, I guess it's a little bit analogous to sort of technical debt and things in in code.

[28:24] Texture: Yeah.

[28:24] Bob: Is if you've if you've got code and you're like, Jesus, look at this, it's so much like complexity and these conditions. I don't think we need any of that. Let's just take all that out.

[28:35] Texture: Yeah.

[28:36] Bob: But but, you know, someone did that for a reason. Yeah. You may not know the reason, but, you know, it was done for a reason and you know, you're going to have some consequences if you if you do that, right? Yeah. You can only be so simple without being, you know, too simplistic and then you you miss out on that uh that detail.

[28:56] Texture: Correct.

[28:57] Bob: Yeah. It's like you you know, with with sort of US legal stuff, you know, this this hot liquid might burn you or whatever. you just know that some shit's happened in the past, right? The reason that all of these things that happened is someone's done something really fucking stupid.

[29:14] Texture: Yeah, and I, you know, as after I became a father, I became really a huge proponent of the idea of if you think a stupid rule exists because the person who made it is stupid, you haven't thought through the problem. It isn't a bunch of people. now I'm not saying this has never existed. Um, but it's not like some nefarious guy at the top who wants to just ruin your life. It's some fucking idiot who did some idiot shit and then now you got to make a stupid rule, you know what I mean? And you got to enforce it with fire. Otherwise, you know, your kids end up dumping plates of food in their closet and you find it six months later and so you know, it's it's just that at scale. But you're going to have to keep me on topic as much as you want to because I am a meander.

[30:03] Bob: Um on on this human side, something I I'd talked about um during my uh maple syrup peace phase was was neurodiversity and the fact that uh normies would not be involved in the early phases of such a project, right? It's absolutely crazy to go and do what you did.

[30:33] Texture: Yeah.

[30:34] Bob: It's crazy what most people did. Yeah. Um so how how does that play out? The fact that in these frontier technologies you don't have normal people. Well, you do, but you have a lot of uh of us people who would not fall into that category. So how how does that all play out? What what what do you think's happening there?

[30:56] Texture: I think it's uh just the the structure of how things have always occurred, right? So you have these kind of people on the front edge and I and I was on the internet from you know, I remember reading when the HTML 2.0 spec was about to come out, right? And so the early days of the internet, it was that. And so I was on the internet all day talking to people and you know, there was a technical barrier and and it's just you have these kind of neuro divergent people show up. So in the early days of crypto, there was a lot of people who were paranoid, um a lot of autistic people and uh spattering of sociopaths who kind of could see that they can make money. And so that that has a profound effect on how things play out, but I think it seems the way that maybe at least in capitalism what happens is huge amounts of capital come in and it just becomes this kind of probability matrix of throw as much energy at this thing as you can on the front end and then whatever survives is going to play out. But kind of if you look at you look at something like Linux or open source technology in general, it's like very autistic and artistic people have a very specific um I've noticed um differentiation from the average person which is they they honestly like believe that the terminal is the greatest interface of all time. It's like they don't grasp that most people need buttons um and so it's like you look at Linux. Linux was kind of a fringe thing, only tech people used and then Google came in and at least had enough sense to like hire some designers to turn into something functional. Steve Jobs did the same thing with OSX. Um, you know, OSX was a a previous like Unix variant. Um, and so you you you need that. You need those people. You need those people who come in who are who are on the edge, who are technical enough to to to be able to communicate with the technical people and understand, but they also need the clout, the money and the power to overrule those people because like Linux had like very horrible user interface and user experience for a long time even when they had window managers. And you have to understand, I was a designer, so I would go into these open source spaces and I I'm going to tell you what, man, like these people who for sure would not let you comment on their code and for sure not let you tell you how they were going to structure it or for sure not tell you, you know, tell them what language they were going to use, have no fucking problem stepping outside of their their own expertise and driving a designer insane. You know what I mean? Very logical, unemotional, totally tapped out of any sense of like what a normal person needs. And they they just beat the designers into the ground. So you really need somebody who has power and the competence and the will and the desire and can put it all together. Um, and and I I don't think we really see that, you know, the wallet's fucking suck. You you know, you could I don't know now but, you know, like a year ago, I clicked a button and and and emptied my uh my hot wallet, right? And like that shouldn't be possible. Like how hard is it to throw up a fucking thing that says, hey, do are you meaning to send every bit of this? This is a lot of money. You know? Like why does it not just say, hey, it didn't even say it in dollars. Do you know what I mean? It was it was ted. It didn't even say there should have been a massive fucking pop up that said you're about to send a $100,000 to somebody. Um are you sure you want to do this?

[34:50] Bob: Yeah.

[34:51] Texture: Or or or I as soon as I clicked the button, knew what it happened. even if there had been like a fucking five minute, you know, delay, right? there's there's but none this isn't happening, right? And and whether it be the structure of the organizations or you know, if the designers are having to argue with the tech people, like whatever it is, it's just grandma still can't use this shit. It's 10 years in. If I have the energy, I I could you know what I mean? I could like within six months we could we could solve these problems and I just don't see.

[35:25] Bob: I mean, I guess I guess this is the reason why things like the ETFs are so appealing, right? It's just. Can I just not deal with any of this shit at all? Uh but I can just like use my brokerage account I've already got and it's just a thing that I buy or sell, right? and and just uh, you know, it's a proxy for it, but most people don't care.

[35:46] Texture: Yeah.

[35:47] Bob: That's fine.

[35:47] Texture: But that that reduces it to an investment vehicle, right? It doesn't it does.

[35:50] Bob: It does.

[35:51] Texture: And and maybe for

[35:52] Bob: It does and then that's that's really a failure as you say on on delivery of of of the holistic platform. Um that that you do need something which is um absolutely better, right? It's just like a product question really, right? It's saying unless the product that you are offering is absolutely better than something existing or or is cheaper or gives you some other benefits or whatever, then normal people are not going to use it. It doesn't matter what the what the, you know, what your worldview is behind that. you you've given them something that's worse than what they have, so they don't care.

[36:38] Texture: Yeah, and so, you know, I think exchanges and things like that kind of acting as a buffer is uh is you know, it's a step. I mean, I you know, ultimately how are these things going to be used? the end user is probably not going to know, you know, um what they're using on the back end anymore than the average person knows what processor is in their phone. So Yeah. No, no. I mean I I guess the hope is it's like a layering thing, right? that that you know, in the same way you've got those D5 primitives that you're going to layer this, you know, whatever social recovery or or buffered amounts or whatever or insurance for fuckups or all this sort of stuff, right? that you should be able to put together a stack of things that have an equivalent kind of characteristic and experience to existing things, but without that strong dependence on, you know, a single legal entity that's, you know, you've got that customer service provider kind of pattern, rather than just it being raw, dangerous, as you experienced there.

[37:50] Texture: Yeah, and I mean, you know, to this day, I mean, I feel anxious all the time because I because I hold crypto, you know, me, I feel anxious all the time, you know what I mean? I think we all I think we all do. So it's like that's not an experience that the average person wants. The average person wants to put their money in a bank account. the average person wants to click a button and if something goes wrong to be able to reverse it. Um you know, we haven't really addressed any of that. That's it's again, just a it's a failure because the people who are in charge think like anyone can do what they're doing and it's not that big of a deal and like all you have to do is do this and like blah blah blah. It's like, no, dude. if all they have to do is click a button, you've done it. That's that's your metric for success. Click one button and not worry about anything. You just know the thing's going to happen and if it doesn't, it'll get fixed.

[38:44] Bob: Yeah, yeah. So when I was looking through um sort of different phases of this period that I've I've been covering in the um in the early days of Ethereum uh sort of website there and I uh I was noticing. So in in January, well in January and February 2014, there's just such a flood of people that came in. I mean, there were a fair chunk in December uh but that just really accelerated uh through January and February. So I mean, how how did that like play out that you've just got like tons and tons of people, you know, rocking up and really like volunteering?

[39:31] Texture: Uh turned everything into Game of Thrones. Yeah. Yeah. that's what happened. It turned everything into Game of Thrones. So like I was there day one, I was doing, I was making sure like, you know, the first thing I did was um Vitalik posted this website that he made. It was piss yellow, he had stolen some other shit coins logo and um just put Ethereum on it and I was like, please don't post this. give me till tomorrow. So I like spun up a logo, send it to him. He was like, oh yeah, this is kind of what I was thinking. I was like, thank god, please don't put that out. Um I don't know if I made a website or and then somebody submitted an image but the image was like like and so just real quick, like what I used to do is I used to be like the dude who um dev shops would call when they were six months behind on a project and they needed it done in three days, right? So I was a designer, full stack developer. So my my skill was I could take your idea and I could I could make it look like it existed forever and you had 10 million dollars in funding in 24 hours, right? So that was my goal at that point. Once I realized that that was a massive gap, I just inserted myself there. And and I'm only telling the story to say, then when everybody flooded in and especially when the Zug house happened, you had all these people kind of going behind other people's backs and um trying to um, push people out and take over their roles and it was it was just a very stressful weird time because um, you get you just get a different type of person, right? The type of people who show up and are just wanting to build the thing because it's cool, that's a type of person. But when they show up and they're like, yeah, let's fucking uh, let's make sure it's us. Let's make sure we're the ones. Let's like fuck those people, let's not communicate with them. So there was a lot of like political maneuvering that was required to survive.

### <a id="miami-house-charles"></a>The Miami House & Charles Hoskinson

[41:38] Bob: Yeah, and I mean I guess that Miami house was where that really like dug in.

[41:44] Texture: Yeah.

[41:45] Bob: You know, because that was that the first time that most people were physically in the same location out of that set of.

[41:51] Texture: It was pretty fun. The weirdest part about that was meeting Charles and um, you know, Charles, I he might have been the first person who was doing kind of the thing that I just said, right? Like he just showed up and kind of inserted himself and was like, I'm going to be CEO and I'm like he was just he was just a fucking liar though, man. He was like 20 four or something and he presented himself like he was 50 years old and he'd been in tech forever. And here's the thing, man. I I actually was probably the most um experienced in terms of I'd lived in Silicon Valley. I'd worked in multiple startups, but despite my personality um on Twitter or even if you meet me in person, like I'm pretty humble when I get into a group of people that I can tell have skills. So I kind of just sat back and didn't try to insert myself. I didn't try to like demand, you know, I be involved in this or that. I just tried to kind of be as helpful as I could. Um so, you know, when I when I talk to uh uh Charles for the first time, I was like, all right, you know, this dude's kind of weird like but we'll we'll see what's up. So like literally the moment I met him in Miami, I shook his hand and I was like, oh god, he's a fucking sociopath. Like okay, well maybe he's our sociopath, you know, like every company has a sociopath, like maybe he's like a well-regulated sociopath. And then when we got to the Miami house, I found out, no, no, he's not a well-regulated sociopath. He's a fucking compulsive liar, manipulative weirdo.

[43:35] Kieren: you're gonna say something? I was just gonna say in Charles defense uh at that time he did look 50 years old, so he he got away with it.

[43:45] Texture: Bro, when I found out he was like fucking seven years younger than me, I was like, what the why am I deferring to this kid? He like what the hell? Um, so yeah, it was it was weird, man. like in the Miami house, I he just said some of the weirdest shit to me. Um there was some thing from, I don't know, I won't go into too many details. I've I've covered them and given interviews to people who have reported on it, but not under my name. so I guess to shield me from any sort of retribution, but I it was weird, man. He just said some weird shit to me. Like he showed me, I don't know, I'll tell this one because I've told it publicly a lot of times, but he he was like, texture, come here and I'm like, what's up? And he's like, check out this text message. And I'm like, okay. And I like just met the dude and he shows me this text message and it's a chick and she's like, I want to suck your cock so bad. Sorry for any children listening. Um, and uh, I'm like, why the fuck is he showing me this? And he's like, you know where I met her? I was like, no. He's like, I met her on the front lines of Afghanistan when I was working for Darpa. I'm like, Jesus Christ, dude. Oh my god, shut the fuck up. And so I will say this because this is something that bothers me. Like for some reason the media all says that the reason that Charles was kicked out was because he wanted to do business and not a nonprofit and like Charles got kicked out because he was a fucking weirdo sociopath who didn't do anything like on above board and like he couldn't be trusted. He he didn't he played games with everybody. Like I was not in his inner circle because I I didn't like he would do I call him sociopath tests where like they say something fucked up to see how you respond. They'll they'll ask you to do unreasonable things to see if you'll do them. Um and then the people that do them and do them without question end up being in his inner circle. They they become the people which which has continued on in his Cardano. So like, you know, he he he just operates in such a way that he gets sick fans around him. He lies to them, he gets them into situations where they're like loyal to him and they don't question him. And then, you know, just weaves a whole reality around that that isn't real. Um and that's that's my assessment of Charles and he was he was he was not kicked out because of business decision I mean, it was a cluster. Now, yeah, I mean, you know, no one else was kicked out. Let's just say that. I guess Amir left but that's another story.

[46:19] Kieren: Well, Amir was kind of kicked out from what I saw based on the fact that people thought he wasn't actually doing anything. He wasn't really like pulling his weight or doing anything useful.

[46:29] Texture: I like Amir as a person. we I haven't talked to him in a few years. We're still cool to this day, but yeah, I mean, what what was the skill set? I don't I don't know.

[46:41] Bob: I don't know. Bivvy sort of stuff. He said he was he was talking to people potential investors sort of thing. Um but uh yeah, and I mean in terms of Charles, it took me a lot of years to really understand Charles, shall we say.

[47:01] Texture: Yeah, you know, I defended you on that because I think you're like a really sweet guy and I I think I understand your perspective, so whether or not I like Charles, I'm going to come defend you.

[47:12] Kieren: Not to dig too much, but um Charles is kind of like body assistant partner guys. His name Jeremy? I'm trying I'm remembering because I actually thought he was a good guy.

[47:22] Texture: Jeremy would?

[47:23] Kieren: Yeah. And maybe everyone's more there, but um, I I'm just to Texture's point, you know, um maybe he was just naive or maybe you guys know more than I do, but uh that was a sort of a strange dichotomy.

[47:38] Texture: Yeah, again, I think it's just whoever would follow him around and not question him. Like that's how you got to be his right hand man. the less questions you asked, the closer best better friend you are. The more you listen to his stupid stories and didn't call him on it. You know what I mean, like, I met this I was on the front lines of Afghanistan for Darpa and now I'm like, shut the fuck up, Charles. with Jeremy, he was notably called him boy, come here boy.

[48:05] Texture: Oh I never saw that.

[48:07] Kieren: What? I'm I'm telling you like I remember some story about him like playing games with people in the Zug house like sending somebody's sending somebody off who whose like wife was there or girlfriend and and telling them that they had to go do this thing for him uh out of town and then when that person had left, he then tried to convince one of the other dudes to like get with the dude's wife. Like just weird stuff, man. Like just things that they're not that they have not why would you do that? You know what I mean? You have an opportunity of a lifetime. The answer is you're a fucking idiot who lied yourself into a situation you shouldn't be in and you're a compulsive lying manipulator. I'm sure it makes him feel smarter or something. I don't know. but like it was just the stories when he when he was gone after the red wedding, I I think everybody breathed a sigh of relief. you know, the biggest problem for me was um after the fundraiser, after the Red wedding, um uh Stefan who I had introduced or I had welcomed into the the the organization. and again, there was a lot of political stuff. If you went to Zug, you got um basically put up in the hierarchy. So I ended up under Stephen. I couldn't go to Zug because my girlfriend was pregnant and I couldn't leave to go to Zug uh for a month. Um and um yeah, I don't know what it was. it was Stefan was I don't know, high energy, high anxiety dude. It was it was a weird thing.

[49:43] Kieren: He was smoking the stereotypical amount of cigarettes at the time.

[49:48] Texture: The stereotypical amount. that dude lived, he had a vape that he puffed like Oh, you're right. It was a vape.

[49:57] Texture: It was a vape. it was it was clouds of smoke and so I went, you know, with Devcon Zero, I went and spent a week with them in um the office in in uh London and dude, Stephen if you weren't having a fucking panic attack, Stephen couldn't tell you're working. It was crazy. And he would pace around this co-working space like nobody else was there. just the whole place looked like a fucking rave, dude. like I think he got kicked out because he was trying to film a TV show and vaping too much. And he had bought like $50,000 worth of camera equipment because his dream was to start a TV show or something on the Ethereum budget.

[50:45] Kieren: Yeah, uh, I hear that London location was was pretty special.

[50:52] Texture: It was weird, man.

### <a id="zug-house-red-wedding"></a>The Zug House & The Red Wedding

[50:56] Bob: Um, did you say you were never in Zug?

[50:59] Texture: Never. No, I never went. Um I had, so my girlfriend at the time was pregnant. Um I had spent a month in Panama with Eric Voris and his team um while she was pregnant. So honestly in retrospect, uh if I could go to I mean you know, it's hard to know how things would have played out because the political stuff with my my I was not political. I didn't have any strategy. I didn't I was not prepared for any of that shit. Uh my I just tried to be like the most authentic, like trustworthy, do what I say person, good to everybody. Like that that's how I survived as long as I did. You know, I don't really do politics. I don't really all of that stuff was really weird.

[51:44] Kieren: And I mean all of this was prior to both the crowd sale and the formation of uh of the Ethereum foundation, right? You know, so the red wedding was 3rd of June 2014. uh the where, you know, you had that, I guess that that final decision of of of the foundation happening uh versus the for profit. uh because you had uh people coming, notably Antonio coming to uh Zug at that point to sign papers, right? You know, it was it was to do with that Swiss legal entity and then it was like, yep, no, we're not signing the papers. the big mess uh and then the foundation uh was July that that was uh incorporated and you still had the crowd sale on going through July and August. So yeah, and the crowd. that's a hell of a long span of time.

[52:54] Texture: Yeah, and we kept saying two weeks. I don't know. That was a meme for a very long time. two weeks. two weeks. two weeks.

[53:06] Bob: Well, the website that was up at the time of the Miami conference uh was showing a countdown to the 1st of February. that was when the sale was meant to start.

[53:17] Texture: Yeah.

[53:18] Bob: And then

[53:18] Texture: you know, I was with Vitalik when the the sale was launched. Uh we had hung out all day in San Francisco. We were in the Westfield Mall in the food court for uh he needed wifi um and he was just sitting there and he just looked up at me and he goes, oh, the crowd sale went live. Um because that wasn't planned. I don't know if Taylor talked to you about that uh when you.

[53:45] Bob: Oh no.

[53:48] Bob: That was an accidental launch, was it?

[53:50] Texture: It was an accident. I don't know. you'll have to ask Taylor about that. But yeah, I guess he accidentally accidentally hit the button. because, you know, it was legal like that's what kept happening is they kept saying, we're waiting on legal, we're waiting on legal, we're waiting on legal, like fuck legal in retrospect, right?

[54:08] Bob: So you and Kieran must have met each other a little bit at various times.

[54:15] Texture: Yeah, we've we've actually hung out more probably in the last five years than we did back then.

[54:21] Kieren: Yeah, um and yeah.

[54:27] Kieren: I guess that Kieran, you saw more of that sort of New Yorkie legal side of of things.

[54:34] Kieren: Yeah, so okay, this is a good good tie in point. So, uh and and Bob at your request, of course, I was digging through the emails trying to piece together some pieces of the timeline, you know, yesterday, day before. So I had um, I think by March, I was um, talking with Vitalik and um, you know, academia at that time. and he kind of found it useful to bounce like protocol economic modeling stuff off, you know, like I was like good at reading the white papers and understanding what they were doing. I could, you know, kind of code at that time. I still kind of code today. but that's sort of we ended up talking about like how the thing should work at a, you know, theory protocol level more than an implementation level. And that kind of I guess and this was covered in the in the red wedding time, there was like we, you know, um a discussion of the usage of funds that ended up like on a whiteboard or something. And uh a lot of it was theoretically earmarked for a research group that meant to solve, you know, hard problems like scalability um in in crypto that, you know, like in practice people have sort of solved today um and not by any of the means we imagined exactly. um but um you know, they they've been solved to to some degree at least. Um, like with layer twos for instance. Um so scalability was very much anticipated as a problem and, you know, it took a couple years but, you know, we we had like $55 fees on NFT transfers at at some point. Um so I think um Vitalik sort of like uh uh talk we we talked about this for a little bit and then he kind of like blessed me as like the representative who's currently in academia and started contacting people and trying to get them interested in Ethereum and then doing like research related to it in general. We even like set a legal entity up uh for a separate research group um at some point. And I'm trying to remember, so Texture, we mostly worked together just on the site basically, like uh I guess you were like, you know, to the web designer at that time, but I I'm trying to remember.

[57:04] Texture: Yeah, I was doing web design. We we had talked about the CRG, cryptocurrency research group. uh and I was like, that's cool. Let me build a website. I remember throwing, you know, faces on it and then it just kind of putter out which, you know, it's you know, like um it would have it would have it would have been a like cool thing, fun thing. I don't know. Um but also uh there's a story about Deoria not anyways, I like I didn't know people were getting paid for a long time. and um I was like living on my sister's love seat in her one bedroom apartment with my daughter because I was like fucking homeless. Uh and working on Ethereum as much as I could uh like multiple other jobs uh to to try to make money and uh I contacted or Deoreo contacted me one day because he was you know, he was in the earlier days like the the primary contact that I would talk to the most. and he called me and he asked me for a favor and uh I was like, yeah man, no problem. And I said, hey, by the way, if you, you know, like listen, I'm in a bad spot right now, is there any way I could get like back pay for 10 grand, which, you know, was not much. and this dude just says, oh no. And I was like, what the fuck? Anyways, I talked to Vitalik. the way it goes back to the CRG um is uh the the CRG was supposed to to to pay me $5,000 so you owe me $5,000 Kieran.

[58:41] Kieren: Oh, yeah, my personally.

[58:45] Texture: Um I I don't know uh you know, given that it was so early, if you could just pay me an ETH uh relative to the price at that time, that would be sick.

[58:53] Kieren: Exactly.

[58:54] Texture: So like 20 cents was the uh presale price. Yeah. It's nothing something like that. so that'll be like uh quite the quite the amount of ETH.

[59:03] Texture: Yeah, so just like 15,000 ETH and we'll call it even.

[59:07] Kieren: All right. All right.

[59:09] Texture: Um

[59:12] Kieren: But yeah, I mean I guess, you know, many that was the case for many people through those those months, you know, and for some people that was nine, 10 months of of unpaid contribution. My my memory is also that Anthony was the main force behind sort of actually not quite stopping but delaying the funding to the the CCRG. So like somehow we got it some of it way later um and it was like not quite the original amount, but it was still something but we were all like working on different things at that time. So we we ended up returning it, I think, but yeah, it was a strange like the the strange delay that happened, I guess like right after the presale. Um so before people are working, you know, uncompensated or largely uncompensated and then right after, there was, I suppose like a big cash grab going on. So like Bob, maybe you know better than this. So there were a bunch of legal entities getting set up, like there was like the Berlin Dev company and then there was another one, like and each everyone tried to like pull out as much of the pie as they could. But like I don't know like.

[1:00:41] Bob: Yeah. Yeah, so so uh Anthony Deoreo, not you. Yeah. Uh in incorporated um Ethereum Canada in February actually, but it was about it was just a few days before everyone went to Zug. So his thought, I guess was everything was going to happen out of Toronto. Um but that didn't happen. Um you had Ethereum Swiss got formed in Switzerland somewhere in April, I think. You had Gav uh incorporating Ethereum Dev in Berlin, um Jeff in Amsterdam, though that took quite a few months, more legalities to it. And there was a there was an Ethereum um in London as well. Most of those F dev ones were kind of co-founded by Vitalik and Gav and Jeff and Mihai kind of group. Um it yeah, it was only the the uh the Toronto one there where it was that I could see Anthony was a director. I don't think he was ever a director on any of the other legal entities. They were basically the, you know, the the dev people um and or Mihai and Taylor. Um but but yeah, when when you'd had the crowd sale and the the the was had been formed and then were the recipients of those funds, there was a whole power grab of a mess of how those funds went out and you know, who how that was done and uh in in cryptopians it talks about Gav maybe wanting to like grab all of the money straight into dev, but then it's like that's probably not legal and it's probably not a good idea either. And Joe wanting to do it sort of a milestone-based slow delivery, which I think is what it sort of ended up being. but you did have this sort of weird situation where um you'd say, oh, do you work for the Ethereum Foundation, but very few people actually work for the Ethereum Foundation. Most people are actually working as staff or contractors for these for-profit legal entities. um which were sort of doing the work.

[1:03:02] Kieren: Yeah, I I think I guess they must have got it kind of like having now run a business for a long time. you got to have, you know, set up sensible contracts and IP agreements and or or you know, sometimes that looks like an inter company agreement and then, you know, they're they if you you do it in the button up way, there's like a lot of headache associated with with with such things. Uh or there can be. I think a lot of that.

[1:03:27] Bob: I have a a strong memory, yes of of like a let's just put all the money in this other legal entity discussion going on like during the whole red wedding week, you know, so.

[1:03:40] Bob: Yes. Yes. Yes. Um and and yeah, so the majority of those legal entities have have since been shut down. Um that was something that Ming did over the course of her time was tidy up all of this like corporate mess that was maybe not really even required in the first place, but uh um

[1:04:05] Kieren: Yeah, I mean I think.

[1:04:07] Texture: I think the go ahead.

[1:04:08] Kieren: Sorry. they could have just worked for the foundation, but I guess they didn't they didn't want to be in Switzerland, which maybe was part of it. And I remember with this, yeah.

[1:04:20] Bob: It it well, this was another funny thing, right? With the uh with the with the spaceship was that there was an expectation at the start there that there was going to be a lot of development work happening in Switzerland as well. and then that never happened.

### The Ethereum Foundation: Structure and Criticism {#ethereum-foundation-structure-criticism}

[1:04:35] Texture: Also, it it kind of uh goes against the Charles was fired for wanting to uh make it corporate when every single person filed their own corporate legal entity in an attempt to divert the funds to their own personal power structure.

[1:04:53] Kieren: Yeah, I'll I'll I'll add because I was in the room for some of this. Gavin immediately started talking about brain drain when there was to be no crypto Google. Um so I guess like they for for a long time they wanted to do hybrid for-profit uh nonprofit and, you know, the the protocol sits in the not for profit and you know, the for profit tries to commercialize and yada yada yada. And of course in the end everyone's like the tokens were worth more than probably any equity would have ever been worth. Yeah. But um, but yeah, I think I think the it's it's definitely a mix of factors. I think it's primarily what you said, but also, you know, like um the I think while there's just a grossness to Charles that like I guess I'm okay with being on record on. I think there was also a dev guy business guy divide uh that to your point on like the autists, right? you know, not that they were great at business like Amir and Charles, but there was more of a like, what do you do? And some of what they did was like try to set up deals with the Canton of Zug and then do like other business development etc that kind of was lost afterwards. I'm not saying it was all that effective in their hands, but um there was this like BD commercialization gap. And so yeah, to your point everyone then started their own companies consensus being the most successful of them and kind of filling that sort of business guy plus commercialization role from there on.

[1:06:35] Kieren: You're you're saying the guy with the most business experience did the best.

[1:06:40] Kieren: That would seems. Yes, I'm just.

[1:06:43] Texture: What's funny is when I met your dad uh in the Miami house, I just thought he was somebody's dad. I mean, obviously, in retrospect he was yours. But um I didn't know that he would go on to become Joe Lubin, you know, I just remember like shooting shit with him and talking to him about thoughts and stuff and he was real like quiet and you know, told me about his uh his time making music videos in Jamaica or whatever.

[1:07:08] Kieren: Yeah, that was right after that. Um he also for a time he believed that he would be a software developer uh for uh Ethereum and then I guess he realized like no one knew anything about business and um Yeah. You know, he'd done, he'd done a, you know, a tour in corporate from the IT side and then run a hedge fund. so he he the most understood how things worked, I guess.

[1:07:31] Texture: Yeah, much better than everyone else. I knew how to uh exist in a fucking early stage startup because I've been doing that for 10 years over and over. So my major contribution was not saying, have you guys ever heard of a four-year vesting period? I thought it a bunch and I was like, I don't want to be here for four years. I'm not going to say that shit.

[1:07:58] Kieren: You know.

[1:08:00] Bob: Yeah, I mean it's something which I've seen uh people comment on a fair bit is um you know, the the early contributor slice which was 9.9% uh of the ether which was shared between the people who who did uh contribute over those over a me once, 10 months or so. Um is equal to the amount that the the Ethereum foundation received. So, you know, all all of the development of everything which happened after that July to the current date has had that same bucket. And uh you know, that is not a typical kind of uh setup for you know, long-term success. talk about the vesting, you know, that uh as I as I look through a lot of these early people, uh, you know, they they they did their part and they moved on.

[1:09:02] Texture: Yeah.

[1:09:02] Bob: But it would have been nice if some people hung around some more.

[1:09:05] Texture: Yeah, I mean, I think to some degree that's why I'm still here in in this space. that and the guilt of learning what people do with the things you create and feeling some sort of like responsibility to kind of try to nudge in a direction, you know, but balancing that with my desire to be anonymous to the most degree that I can was difficult.

[1:09:32] Bob: Yes. It might be another coup.

[1:09:29] Kieren: That's what I'm saying like you know, you could be the best guy with the best intentions, with the best ideas and you're the guy to do it and if if the power structure is designed around um, you know, placating people who are only concerned about their place in the palace, um you know, it's happened to me multiple times in my life. Uh they kick you, they kick you out because you're a threat to what they're trying to accomplish in their minds. Um they don't understand that, you know, if you allow the guy who's doing this to to really create something that lasts and is bigger than you're going to get a bigger of a piece of a a bigger uh slice from a bigger pie. But if you completely undermine everybody who's trying to do that, then you're going to end up with a nothing, you know?

[1:10:27] Bob: I guess at the recent uh at CC in Cancun, uh there was a slide which Jerome had on there uh which was talking about uh dissenting voices and both myself and Greg Covin were up there as as Ethereum dissidents.

[1:10:41] Texture: I didn't get it. Oh, it's all right. Nobody remembers me.

[1:10:45] Bob: I'm not.

[1:10:46] Texture: Congrats though.

[1:10:47] Bob: No, sorry. You you you're not uh you're not known enough, I don't know.

[1:10:51] Texture: Oh no.

[1:10:52] Bob: You're not you're not being loud enough.

[1:10:54] Texture: No, it's all right. I uh I only have the number of followers I do because of a couple jokes I made one of them being texture punk. So I I very much don't mind being lost to history if it means I'm not on someone's let's rob this guy list.

[1:11:13] Bob: Well. Um I think that's maybe a good kind of place to wrap up. So I I wish you all the very best and uh in enjoy your life.

[1:11:28] Texture: Yeah. Well, Bob, thanks for having me on. If you want to uh have me on again, I'm more than happy to always give you my time. Um good to talk to you Kieran.

[1:11:37] Kieren: Hey, pleasure. It been a it's not too long, but uh No, man. Um yeah. great great to chat again and we'll do again soon.

[1:11:47] Texture: Yeah, maybe maybe so. Maybe we'll see you soon. Um and then thanks for everybody who's come to listen and uh, yeah. Don't follow me.
