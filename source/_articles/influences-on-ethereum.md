Ethereum did not emerge in a vacuum. The white paper and early blog posts explicitly cite numerous predecessor projects, concepts, and thinkers. This page documents the key influences on Ethereum's design.

## Cited in the White Paper

The [Ethereum white paper](/articles/white-paper/) directly references these projects and concepts:

### Bitcoin (2009)
- **Creator:** Satoshi Nakamoto
- Ethereum's most fundamental influence. The white paper opens by acknowledging Bitcoin as "a radical development in money and currency" and blockchain technology as "a tool of distributed consensus."

### b-money (1998)
- **Creator:** Wei Dai
- "The first proposal to introduce the idea of creating money through solving computational puzzles as well as decentralized consensus." Cited in the white paper's history section.

### Reusable Proofs of Work (2005)
- **Creator:** Hal Finney
- Combined ideas from b-money with Adam Back's Hashcash puzzles. Cited as a precursor to cryptocurrency.

### Colored Coins
- On-blockchain digital assets representing custom currencies and financial instruments. Vitalik was involved in the colored coins project before creating Ethereum.

### Namecoin
- A fork of Bitcoin for decentralized domain name registration. Cited as an example of alternative blockchain applications.

### Smart Contracts
- **Creator:** Nick Szabo (concept, 1990s)
- The white paper links directly to Szabo's original essay on smart contracts. Szabo was the keynote speaker at DEVCON1.

### Smart Property
- The concept of using blockchain tokens to represent ownership of physical devices, cited in the white paper's opening.

### Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
- Vitalik had written extensively about DAOs on the Ethereum blog before the white paper, including a three-part series on "Bootstrapping a Decentralized Autonomous Corporation."

### Mastercoin (now Omni)
- The white paper discusses Mastercoin as an example of building on top of Bitcoin, noting the complexity of implementing features through Bitcoin's scripting system.

### Merkle Trees
- **Creator:** Ralph Merkle
- The fundamental data structure used in Ethereum's state storage (Patricia Merkle Tries).

## Other Key Influences

### Chaumian Blinding / e-Cash (1980s–1990s)
- **Creator:** David Chaum
- The anonymous e-cash protocols of the 1980s and 1990s are cited in the white paper as early precursors to digital currency.

### Hashcash
- **Creator:** Adam Back
- Proof-of-work system referenced in the white paper's history of cryptocurrency.

### Bitcoin Magazine
- Vitalik Buterin co-founded Bitcoin Magazine in 2011 and wrote extensively about cryptocurrency before creating Ethereum. His deep involvement in the Bitcoin ecosystem directly shaped his vision for a more general-purpose blockchain.

### Primecoin
- An alternative cryptocurrency that used useful proof-of-work (finding prime number chains), cited by Vitalik in discussions about mining.

### Ripple / Stellar
- Consensus-based systems discussed in Vitalik's research on proof-of-stake alternatives.

### Lisp and Functional Programming
- The original Ethereum scripting language designs drew on concepts from Lisp and functional programming. The early "Ethereum Script" went through several iterations before converging on the EVM and Solidity.

## Philosophical Influences

### Cypherpunk Movement
- The broader cypherpunk philosophy of using cryptography to protect individual liberty. Vinay Gupta's DEVCON1 talk was titled "Dangerous Old Men: cypherpunk's failure, Ethereum's success."

### Free Software Movement
- Ethereum was open-source from day one, with all clients freely available.

### Austrian Economics
- Vitalik's early writings reference debates about monetary policy, issuance models, and the nature of money that draw on Austrian economic thought.

## Contemporary Projects

Several projects existed alongside early Ethereum and influenced its direction:

- **Counterparty** — Financial instruments on Bitcoin
- **BitShares** — Delegated proof-of-stake blockchain by Dan Larimer
- **NXT** — Pure proof-of-stake cryptocurrency
- **Truthcoin/Hivemind** — Paul Sztorc's prediction market design
- **Augur** — Prediction markets, among the earliest Ethereum DApps
