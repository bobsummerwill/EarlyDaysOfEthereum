Nick Savers was a volunteer developer who worked on the EthereumJ Java client and helped establish Ethereum's continuous integration (CI) infrastructure.

## EthereumJ and CI

Nick was one of the key volunteer developers on the EthereumJ (Java) client, alongside Roman Mandeleil. Both visited the ÐΞV team in Berlin and worked to create an independent implementation of the Ethereum protocol.

As Gavin Wood noted in his October 2014 ÐΞV update:

> "I must thank the EthereumJ (Java client) volunteer developers Roman and Nick, both of whom have visited us in our prototype hub here in Berlin, and who work tirelessly to find different and innovative new ways of interpreting the formal protocol specification."

Nick also played a key role in setting up the continuous integration system alongside Caktux and Joris:

> "Caktux an early volunteer and maintainer of the Ncurses-based C++ Ethereum front-end neth has been invaluable (alongside Joris and Nick Savers) in getting a continuous integration system up and running."
