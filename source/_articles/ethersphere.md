Ethersphere was a GitHub organization created by [Viktor Trón](/people/viktor-tron/) that served as the collaborative home for [Swarm](/articles/swarm/) development. It was one of the first Ethereum-related "brands," alongside [Eris Industries](https://erisindustries.com/) (which later became [Monax](https://monax.io/)).

## Origins

[Viktor Trón](/people/viktor-tron/) registered Ethersphere as a GitHub organization on March 14, 2014. In his [Early Days of Ethereum interview](/videos/episode010-viktor-tron/), Viktor described it as somewhat aspirational:

> "Well, it's kind of, it was wishful thinking that it might be Ethersphere but on the other hand I kind of, I did register that as an organization on GitHub at least and even I think it was pretty much one of the first Ethereum related brands in a way."

The organization became the working home for the Budapest-based team developing Swarm, with code being committed through Ethersphere to the Ethereum codebase:

> "So Ethersphere was the home of maybe most of our work and then we kind of committing through that to the Ethereum code base."

## Team

The core Ethersphere team consisted of:

- **[Viktor Trón](/people/viktor-tron/)** - First Ethereum Foundation employee, hired by [Jeff Wilcke](/people/jeff-wilcke/) in February 2015
- **[Daniel Nagy](/people/daniel-nagy/)** - Contractor for [ETHDEV](/articles/eth-dev-cic/) from October 2014, brought the original Swarm concepts
- **[Zsolt Felföldi](/people/zsolt-felfoldi/)** - Joined in 2015 to work on the light client

Viktor noted that while he and Daniel were both at [DEVCON0](/articles/devcon0/), Zsolt joined later: "And later Zsolt Felföldi, like already hired to work on the light client. I think it was in 2015 already."

## Legacy

Ethersphere was never a formal legal entity - it functioned as a GitHub organization and informal collaborative umbrella. When Swarm eventually spun out from the Ethereum Foundation in 2019-2021, it became the Swarm Association, a formal organization based in Switzerland.

The [Ethersphere GitHub organization](https://github.com/ethersphere) remains active today as the home of Swarm development, including the Bee client.
