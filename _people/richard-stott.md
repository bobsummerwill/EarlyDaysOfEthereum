It appears that Richard died in 2024:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RIP Richard Wild (aka Richard Stott). He was a designer who worked on Ethereum in the early days. <a href="https://t.co/6YQvQvQvQv">pic.twitter.com/6YQvQvQvQv</a></p>&mdash; Laura Shin (@blockchaingirl) <a href="https://twitter.com/blockchaingirl/status/1818203032980471885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

His last tweet was [posted on 25th May 2024](https://x.com/raidraidrune/status/1794755939540906305).

On 8th August 2025, Janina told Bob via Twitter DM that *"It was on LinkedIn where I read about it.  on his profile.  the bio said 'deceased' and somebody had posted something from this profile saying they are a family member.  asking for privacy, etc.  the profile got deactivated and reactivated since.  just checked, it seems deactivated again."*

[Bob]({{ '/people/bob-summerwill/' | relative_url }}) intended to speak to Richard in 2017/2018 during Bob's "maple syrup diplomacy phase" with [Charles]({{ '/people/charles-hoskinson/' | relative_url }}), after this [tweet-thread](https://twitter.com/raidraidrune/status/936638941947625474), but the call never actually happened.
