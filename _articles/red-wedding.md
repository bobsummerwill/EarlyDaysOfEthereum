description: 'The "Red Wedding" was the meeting at Zug in June 2014 where Charles Hoskinson and Amir Chetrit were ejected from the project'
---

In early June of 2014, all of the co-founders headed to The Spaceship in Zug.  The [EthSuisse]({{ '/articles/ethsuisse/' | relative_url }}) for-profit legal entity had been incorporated in Zug on 28th February 2014 by [Mihai Alisie]({{ '/people/mihai-alisie/' | relative_url }}) and [Herbert Sterchi]({{ '/people/herbert-sterchi/' | relative_url }}).  The original purpose of the trip was to have the in-person meeting required by law for the other seven co-founders to be added as officers of the for-profit legal entity.

[Charles Hoskinson]({{ '/people/charles-hoskinson/' | relative_url }}), [Anthony Di Iorio]({{ '/people/anthony-di-iorio/' | relative_url }}), [Amir Chetrit]({{ '/people/amir-chetrit/' | relative_url }}) and [Joe Lubin]({{ '/people/joseph-lubin/' | relative_url }}) flew in from North America.  [Jeff Wilcke]({{ '/people/jeff-wilcke/' | relative_url }}) flew in from Amsterdam, [Gavin Wood]({{ '/people/gavin-wood/' | relative_url }}) from Berlin, and [Vitalik]({{ '/people/vitalik-buterin/' | relative_url }}), from his latest nomad location.

Tensions were at boiling point at that stage, so instead of a signing ceremony it turned into a "get all the venom out" bloodbath of a meeting on 3rd June 2014.

The leadership group (the 8 co-founders) was dissolved, with [Vitalik]({{ '/people/vitalik-buterin/' | relative_url }}) asking [Mihai]({{ '/people/mihai-alisie/' | relative_url }}), [Jeff]({{ '/people/jeff-wilcke/' | relative_url }}), [Gavin]({{ '/people/gavin-wood/' | relative_url }}), [Joe]({{ '/people/joseph-lubin/' | relative_url }}), [Anthony]({{ '/people/anthony-di-iorio/' | relative_url }}) to return, with [Charles]({{ '/people/charles-hoskinson/' | relative_url }}) and [Amir]({{ '/people/amir-chetrit/' | relative_url }}) being removed.  They remained co-founders and, like all the other early contributors, they still received their ether allocations.  Stephan and Taylor were appointed to take their places.

This story is told in detail in The Cryptopians, Out of Ether and Infinite Machine, and has been mentioned in many other articles and interviews.

[Charles]({{ '/people/charles-hoskinson/' | relative_url }}) is still incredibly bitter about these events.  He allegedly gave all of his ether allocation to his assistant, [Jeremy Wood]({{ '/people/jeremy-wood/' | relative_url }}), in frustration.  [Jeremy]({{ '/people/jeremy-wood/' | relative_url }}) left the Ethereum project himself only a few months later.

[Charles]({{ '/people/charles-hoskinson/' | relative_url }}) and Jeremy later collaborated as co-founders of [IOHK](https://iohk.io/) (later partially rebranded as IO Global) in April 2015, a company most famous for the development of the [Cardano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(blockchain_platform)) blockchain.

[Amir]({{ '/people/amir-chetrit/' | relative_url }}) did not seem to care about his removal.  He retained his ether allocation and now did not even need to do any more work!  He had been quite clear that his involvement was primarily motivated by money and he continued to spend lots of time on colored coins when while being an Ethereum co-founder.
