The UK legal entity was originally incorporated as ETH DEV Ltd at Companies House, Cardiff, by Gavin Wood, Jeff Wilcke and Vitalik Buterin.

It was formed [on 7th August 2014](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09165464/filing-history/MzEwNTEzMzY0MGFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&download=0) as a private limited company and converted into a Community Interest Company (CIC) on [18th December 2014](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09165464/filing-history/MzExMzc1Mjc1NmFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&download=0).  Wikipedia [defines CICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company) as:

> A community interest company (CIC, pronounced "see-eye-see", or colloquially, "kick")
> is a form of social enterprise in the United Kingdom intended "for people wishing to
> establish businesses which trade with a social purpose..., or to carry on other activities
> for the benefit of the community"

This incorporation occurred just under a month after the incorporation of the Stiftung Ethereum on 14th July 2014, with the intention of the ETHDEV entities providing contracted services to the Foundation for development of the protocol.  The EthSuisse for-profit was being quickly decommissioned at this stage, as the project switched definitively to a non-profit model after the "Red Wedding" on 7th June 2014.

All information on the legal entity is publicly available from [Companies House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_House), an executive agency of the British Government, here under [ETH DEV C.I.C. (company number 09165464)](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09165464/) from free.

There is a [blue plaque at 61 Rivington Street in London](https://openplaques.org/plaques/57720) which commemorates the launch of the Ethereum network on 30th July 2015.  That was the location of the London office at that time, with Stephan Tual, Vinay Gupta, Ian Meikle and Ken Kappler working there.
