Jeremy Wood served as Executive Assistant to [Charles Hoskinson](/people/charles-hoskinson/) (self-appointed "CEO" of Ethereum) between December 2013 and September 2014. He remained with Ethereum for several months after Charles's departure at the "[Red Wedding](/articles/red-wedding/)" in June 2014.

## Early Days

Jeremy appears in photographs from the Miami house in January 2014. [Taylor Gerring](/people/taylor-gerring/) documented the gathering:

> "Late into the night, some of our team gathered on the back patio for interviews. In addition to those named in yesterday's photo, appearing below are Charles, Joe, Jeremy, Dino, and one unidentified smoker." — Taylor Gerring, January 27, 2014

He was also present at the Switzerland AirBnB:

> "Back in the AirBnB since we had no furniture in the Spaceship. Jeremy Wood is in the foreground and you can see blankets hanging from over the loft. These would be our final nights in Meierskappel." — Taylor Gerring, March 4, 2022

## Relationship with Charles

Jeremy served as Charles's right-hand man during the early Ethereum period. [Anthony D'Onofrio](/people/anthony-d-onofrio/) described the dynamic:

> "Again, I think it was just whoever would follow him around and not question him. Like that's how you got to be his right hand man. The less questions you ask, the closer, better friend you are, the more you listen to his stupid stories." — Anthony D'Onofrio

Bob Summerwill noted Charles's treatment of Jeremy:

> "With Jeremy Wood, he notably called him boy. 'Come here, boy!'" — Bob Summerwill

## Ether Allocation

After Charles was removed from leadership, he allegedly gave all of his ether allocation to Jeremy in frustration.

## After Ethereum

Charles and Jeremy later collaborated as co-founders of [IOHK](https://iohk.io/) (later partially rebranded as IO Global) in April 2015, a company most famous for the development of the [Cardano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(blockchain_platform)) blockchain.
