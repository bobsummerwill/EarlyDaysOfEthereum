Brendan Eich is an American computer programmer and technology executive. He created the JavaScript programming language in 1995 at Netscape and co-founded the Mozilla project, Mozilla Foundation, and Mozilla Corporation.

## Brave and Basic Attention Token

In 2015, Eich co-founded Brave Software with Brian Bondy. Brave is a privacy-focused web browser that blocks ads and trackers by default. In 2017, Brave launched the Basic Attention Token (BAT), an Ethereum ERC-20 token designed to improve digital advertising by rewarding users for their attention while preserving privacy.

The BAT token sale on May 31, 2017 raised approximately $35 million worth of ETH in under 30 seconds, becoming one of the fastest token sales in Ethereum's history. BAT is used within the Brave browser ecosystem to compensate users who opt in to viewing privacy-respecting ads.

## Connection to Ethereum

BAT was one of the notable early ERC-20 tokens built on Ethereum, demonstrating the platform's capability for token-based business models. Eich has been a vocal advocate for decentralization and user privacy in the web ecosystem.
