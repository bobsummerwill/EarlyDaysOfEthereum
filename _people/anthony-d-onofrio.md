Texture was the first "community guy", reading the White Paper as one of the very people outside of the initial set of recipients and having his mind blown:

*"I actually had envisioned everything in the paper before. I was more blown away by the fact that I found it and Vitalik a week after having the vision" - [Texture on Twitter, 29th August 2025](https://x.com/iamtexture/status/1961541627694219532)*

Here he is, presenting on Ethereum with [Vitalik]({{ '/people/vitalik-buterin/' | relative_url }}) on 15th December 2013!

Incidentally, this was a "Salon Talk" for DCTRL, right here in my Vancouver hometown! ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

*"Texture (Anthony d'Onofrio) is spearheading community development for Ethereum in North America, he has written many works on Decentralized governance & community incubators."*

Here are a couple of more recent interviews.  This one is from 2022:

As was this one, later that year:

In January of 2025, with dissatisfaction brewing around the Ethereum Foundation, Texture wrote an opinion piece in Coindesk signed off "With Love, Texture":

<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/01/21/the-ethereum-foundation-has-lost-its-way" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Ethereum Foundation Has Lost Its Way</a>

Love is a common theme for Texture, whose Medium account is:

He used to stand on street corners giving out "free hugs" from what I remember.  I'll have to ask him about that!

He posted this in 2018 on the fourth anniversary of the Miami beach house photo taken on 29th January 2014:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/iamtexture/status/958018640615362565">https://twitter.com/iamtexture/status/958018640615362565</a></p>&mdash; Texture (@iamtexture) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamtexture/status/958018640615362565">January 29, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And, further down the thread he said this, with my own efforts at Maple Syrup diplomacy in full flood at that point:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/iamtexture/status/958023651411947520">https://twitter.com/iamtexture/status/958023651411947520</a></p>&mdash; Texture (@iamtexture) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamtexture/status/958023651411947520">January 29, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And, a little later in the month in response to my epic "Calling for an End to Tribalism in Ethereum":

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/iamtexture/status/956932468321349632">https://twitter.com/iamtexture/status/956932468321349632</a></p>&mdash; Texture (@iamtexture) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamtexture/status/956932468321349632">January 27, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I stuck that epic rant into blog form a few days later:

<a href="https://bobsummerwill.com/2018/03/01/a-call-for-an-end-to-tribalism-in-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
  <img src="/images/bobsummerwill.com/2025.09.03/2018.03.01_a-call-for-an-end-to-tribalism-in-ethereum-screenshot.png" alt="A Call for an End to Tribalism in Ethereum blog post screenshot" style="width: 50%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 18px 0;" />
</a>

And that turned into my opening keynote at the very first [ETHCC](https://ethcc.io) in Paris a week and a half later:

<a href="https://bobsummerwill.com/2018/03/08/ethereum-community-conference-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

</a>

Which I opened with the epic "Ethereum - Your Turn", from 12th March 2014 with voiceover by the aforementioned Charles Hoskinson:
