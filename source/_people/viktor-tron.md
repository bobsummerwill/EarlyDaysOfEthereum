Viktor Trón is the founder of [Swarm](/articles/swarm/), Ethereum's decentralized storage layer, and one of the first employees on the go-ethereum team. A "freedom seeking individual" drawn to Ethereum through Austrian economics and anarchist ideals, he has been building the decentralized web stack since February 2014.

## Background

Before Ethereum, Viktor worked at BBC News Labs on [The Juicer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rdnewslabs/projects/juicer) project, ingesting and categorizing news archives. He discovered Bitcoin through a friend from an anarchist Facebook group:

> "Bitcoin came into my life through a friend who I knew from an anarchist club or like Facebook group basically. So it's kind of, he introduced me to it on ideological grounds but of course I was very interested in tech as well."

## Discovering Ethereum

Viktor first watched [Vitalik Buterin](/people/vitalik-buterin/)'s Miami presentation online, then attended a [Coinscrum "Alternative Stage"](https://web.archive.org/web/20140405100113/http://www.iamsatoshi.com/coinscrum-alternative-stage-london) meetup in London on February 3, 2014, where [Gavin Wood](/people/gavin-wood/) presented Ethereum:

> "I left the job because I found Ethereum. I was very excited right away. So when Gavin visited this kind of new web meetup... I was absolutely taken aback and I found it was amazing and game changer."

He came prepared with challenging questions about sharding, but was won over:

> "Bit by bit when I understood that they all had answers to every question that I can ever think of, then that's when I got to admit that they are probably the geniuses I really want to look up to and have in my environment to learn from."

The next day, Viktor was already hacking on the C++ codebase. He met Gavin at a cafe in Dalston and was added to the early Skype group (around 20 people at the time).

## Joining Geth

Viktor met [Jeff Wilcke](/people/jeff-wilcke/) at one of the first London Ethereum meetups. He began contributing to go-ethereum and was hired by Jeff in September/October 2014:

> "I kind of saw that it's quite an international crowd and from all over the world kind of doing this thing. So I kind of started to take it very seriously. As I said, I kind of left my job and joined the ranks."

[Jeff Wilcke](/people/jeff-wilcke/) described Viktor in his [first development update](/articles/jeffs-ethereum-dev-update-i/): "Vik is a crazy math-head and is currently hacking away at the new DEVP2P and testing it rigourously. I've known Vik all the way back since the start of the project somewhere in Jan/Feb, he's a great guy and a real asset to this team."

Viktor was among the first paid employees on the Geth team, joining around the same time as [Alex van de Sande](/people/alex-van-de-sande/) and [Felix Lange](/people/felix-lange/).

## The Holy Trinity and Swarm

Viktor was deeply committed to the [Holy Trinity](/articles/holy-trinity/) vision—Ethereum for compute, [Swarm](/articles/swarm/) for storage, and [Whisper](/articles/whisper/) for messaging—that emerged in May 2014 at talks in Whitechapel, London.

He created [Ethersphere](https://github.com/ethersphere) as a GitHub organization for Swarm development, working with [Daniel Nagy](/people/daniel-nagy/) and later [Zsolt Felföldi](/people/zsolt-felfoldi/).

Despite Swarm being officially defunded during the 2015 austerity period, Jeff quietly allowed the team to continue working:

> "I remember that maybe it's not a secret anymore but Jeff kind of let us keep working on Swarm throughout this period."

The first Swarm release was included in Geth 1.5 in December 2016. Viktor recruited [Nick Johnson](/people/nick-johnson/) to the Swarm team, where Nick developed [ENS](https://ens.domains/) before spinning it out.

## Swarm Independence

Viktor continued working within the Ethereum Foundation until 2018-2019, when the Swarm codebase was separated from Geth. The Swarm Association was founded in Switzerland, and the Swarm token was launched in 2021. The new Bee client was developed using [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) instead of [devp2p](/articles/devp2p/).

Swarm work continues to the present day with Viktor leading the project.
