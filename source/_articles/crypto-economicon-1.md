The Crypto Economicon was a small, invite-only technical conference held in San Francisco in late January 2015. It was organized by Kieren James-Lubin and others who knew that many people from the Ethereum and broader blockchain community would be in the Bay Area that week.

## Origins

As Kieren James-Lubin described in his interview:

> "We decided to run kind of a parallel technical conference that week, which we named the verbose Crypto Economicon."

The name was inspired by the emerging field of "crypto economics," a term either invented or popularized by Vitalik Buterin and explored extensively by Vlad Zamfir in his work on proof of stake.

## Format

The conference had approximately 60 attendees and featured two academic track days and a business track day. It was co-hosted with a company called Coinify, run by Tom Ding, in a building in San Francisco.

## Significance

Despite its small size, the conference brought together many people who would go on to become major figures in the blockchain space:

> "That conference was like 60 people... almost everyone who went either is already a well-known figure, if they weren't then, or went on to do something really, really interesting." — Kieren James-Lubin

It was at this conference that Kieren James-Lubin met Victor Wong in person for the first time. The two, along with Jim Hormuzdiar, would go on to co-found BlockApps.
