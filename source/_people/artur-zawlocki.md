Artur Zawłocki was a software engineer at imapp, the Warsaw-based firm co-founded by Julian Zawistowski that was contracted by Ethereum ÐΞV UG. He worked on the C++ team, contributing to the Ethereum Virtual Machine implementation.

## EVM Work at imapp

Together with Paweł Bylica and the rest of the imapp team, Artur worked on implementing a just-in-time (JIT) compiled version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This work was acknowledged in Gavin Wood's October 2014 ÐΞV update, which praised imapp's "considerable expertise" in making "computationally-complex contracts a reasonably affordable possibility."
