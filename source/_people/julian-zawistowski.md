Julian Zawistowski co-founded [imapp](https://www.imapp.pl/), a Warsaw-based software firm specializing in advanced languages and compilers. In 2014, imapp was contracted by Ethereum ÐΞV UG to work on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

As noted in Gavin Wood's October 2014 ÐΞV update:

> "Furthermore the guys at IMAPP, a software firm in Warsaw specialising in advanced languages and compilers deserve a great nod for their on-going efforts at using their considerable expertise in implementing a just-in-time (JIT) compiled version of the Ethereum virtual machine and making computationally-complex contracts a reasonably affordable possibility."

The imapp team, including Artur Zawłocki and Paweł Bylica, made significant contributions to the EVM's performance through their JIT compilation work. imapp has continued as a blockchain-focused software house since 2013.

## Golem Project

Julian went on to found the Golem Project, a decentralized computing network built on Ethereum. The Golem whitepaper was first introduced in 2016, and the project conducted one of the notable early Ethereum token sales. Golem aimed to create a global, open-source, decentralized supercomputer that anyone could access, allowing users to rent out their computing power or buy it from others.
