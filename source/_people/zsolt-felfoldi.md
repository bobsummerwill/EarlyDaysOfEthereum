Zsolt Felföldi is a long-time Geth core developer, primarily known for his work on the Light Client protocol. He has known [Daniel Nagy](/people/daniel-nagy/) since they met at high school in 1994.

Zsolt shared his Ethereum origin story:

> "My Ethereum story is this: I knew [Daniel](/people/daniel-nagy/) since 1994 (high school) and some people from his circles knew about Ethereum first. He and [Viktor](/people/viktor-tron/) (who was already working on Geth already by then) went to [DEVCON0](/articles/devcon0/) (I wasn't there yet), where they pitched the p2p storage project idea and [Daniel](/people/daniel-nagy/) got hired too (Oct 2014 probably).
>
> Then [Daniel](/people/daniel-nagy/) involved me, I started implementing the basics of [Swarm](/articles/swarm/) in Nov 2014. Then I joined a Geth team meetup in Feb 2015 in Amsterdam where [Jeff](/people/jeff-wilcke/) hired me too. My contract started on 1st March 2015 but [Jeff](/people/jeff-wilcke/) said I am not hired to do Swarm because there are other important things to do and I should design and implement a light client protocol.
>
> So I've never actually been officially involved with [Ethersphere](/articles/ethersphere/) even though I'm probably listed as a contributor here and there. Since then I never left Geth, once I had a 5 month sabbatical when I did not invoice but other than that I've been continuously on the Geth team and paid by the [EF](/articles/stiftung-ethereum/) since then."

Zsolt's initial focus was on the Light Client sub-protocol, though he also contributed to [Swarm](/articles/swarm/) and the Geth client in general.
