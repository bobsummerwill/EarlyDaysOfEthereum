Steven Nerayoff was an early advisor to the Ethereum project during 2014, providing legal and strategic counsel during the project's formative period. He has described himself as having been involved in structuring the Ethereum token sale.

In September 2019, Nerayoff was arrested on federal extortion charges by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, related to allegations of extorting a cryptocurrency company. The charges were ultimately dropped in 2023.
