Martin Becze was an early Ethereum core developer who joined the project in May 2014. He worked extensively on the JavaScript implementation of Ethereum and was a key contributor to the ethereumjs project.

## EIPs

Martin played a foundational role in the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) process. He was one of the initial editors and maintainers of the [EIPs repository](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs) on GitHub, with numerous commits from late 2015 through mid-2016 establishing the structure and workflow for how protocol changes would be proposed and documented.

## ewasm

Martin was also a contributor to the ewasm (Ethereum WebAssembly) initiative, which explored replacing the EVM with a WebAssembly-based execution engine.
