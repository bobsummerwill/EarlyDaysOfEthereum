Viktor was the first employee of the Ethereum Foundation, being hired by Jeff Wilcke in February 2014 to work as a Geth core developer.  He later colloborated with Daniel Nagy on the Swarm protocol.  Swarm development was originally part of the ongoing Geth development.

*(For a long time, Bob was under the false impression that Alex Leverington was the first employee, in August or September 2014, but it looks like Alex was only the first hire for ETHDEV in Berlin specifically.  Many other people were working on Ethereum for months before any of this, of course, but not as paid employees or contractors)*

Ethersphere was created in March 2014 by Daniel Nagy and Viktor Trón (maybe?), primarily as an umbrella for their Swarm development activities.

Viktor will have left the Ethereum Foundation in late 2015, at the same time as Daniel Nagy, when Swarm work was defunded by the Ethereum Foundation under financial pressure.  The Swarm Foundation was founded much later.

Swarm work continues to the present day.
