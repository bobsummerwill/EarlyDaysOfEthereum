On Friday August 14th at 5pm ConsenSys began its 48 hour "dapp-a-thon" where 12 teams set out to build decentralized applications from scratch for the Ethereum network. Participants used development tools provided by ConsenSys like the EtherCamp IDE, the BlockApps testnet and deployment system, and Lightwallet. The developers of these tools gave tutorials on how to utilize and integrate these tools into dApps and were accessible if the participants ran into trouble along the way. As a result, most teams were able to create a working prototype of their decentralized vision in just 2 days!
