He attended the [Cryptoeconomicon 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20160421023643/http://www.cryptoeconomicon.com/) conference on January 26th to January 29th of 2015, which had a "Who's Who?" of speakers and attendees.

Later that year, Kieren [announced BlockApps STRATO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8jIUg5jXjg_) with Victor Wong and James Hormuzdiar at [DEVCON1 (snapshot)](https://web.archive.org/web/20151124053027/https://devcon.ethereum.org/).  The Haskell client and the software stack surrounding it was used as the client software for the first Blockchain-as-a-Service on Microsoft Azure which was also [announced at DEVCON1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExsTb0iglcs).  The talks were back-to-back on 10th November 2014.
