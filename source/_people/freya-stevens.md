Freya Stevens was announced PR/Marketing lead, based out of Cambridge, UK, in a November 2014 blog post by Stephan Tual:

*"As the media attention is now intensifying rapidly, I'm pleased to welcome Freya Stevens to the team as PR/Marketing lead. Freya will help us build a shared database of media leads, write articles and make complex technology palatable to the general public while identifying strong story angles. Freya is based out of Cambridge, UK."*

But she never actually started the role.  She still works in the industry.
