Alex van de Sande (known as "avsa") was the designer and lead of the Mist browser project at ETHDEV and later the Ethereum Foundation. He joined the Ethereum project in October 2014 and was instrumental in envisioning and building Mist, the first dedicated Web3 browser.

## Mist Browser

Alex first envisaged the Mist browser in November 2014 as a desktop application that would allow users to browse and interact with decentralized applications (dapps) on Ethereum. He hired Fabian Vogelsteller in January 2015, and together they built up a team that included Ramesh Nair, Luca Zeug, Victor Maia, Everton Fraga, Marc Garreau, and Ryan Ghods.

The team first shipped the Ethereum Wallet as a constrained single-app browser before building out the full Mist browser. Alex announced the sunsetting of Mist in March 2019 due to usability and security concerns.
