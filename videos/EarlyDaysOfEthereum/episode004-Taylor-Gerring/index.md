## Early Days of Ethereum
### Episode IV featuring Taylor Gerring - released 8th August 2025

After a long hiatus since [Episode III](https://github.com/bobsummerwill/EarlyDaysOfEthereum/blob/main/videos/EarlyDaysOfEthereum/episode003/index.md) in November 2023, we returned with another episode of The Early Days of Ethereum.

Ethereum OG and "co Founder" [Taylor Gerring](https://github.com/bobsummerwill/EarlyDaysOfEthereum/blob/main/people/TaylorGerring/index.md) joined us as a guest to talk about his experiences in the very early days of the Ethereum project, starting in December 2013.

Bob Summerwill hosted this episode with [Kieren James-Lubin](https://x.com/kjameslubin) commenting a few times.  Bob and Taylor overlapped at the Ethereum Foundation in 2016 and Taylor and Kieren's paths crossed in some of these early months of the project.

In 2013 he was travelling in Europe and met Mihai Ailise in Milan and that is what led him to Ethereum.  After a year or so as a hardcore Bitcoiner he started looking at other things which could be done, with Namecoin as a prime example and could see the writing was on the wall when he read the Ethereum white paper three times and had it click in his head that this was the way forward.

In Miami in January 2014 he was working for a Hive Bitcoin wallet.  At the behest of Wendell Davis
